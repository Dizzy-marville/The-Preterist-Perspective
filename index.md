# The Unified Gospel Narrative

> *"That you may know the certainty of the things you have been taught…"* — Luke 1:4

Welcome to a unified harmony of the Gospel accounts—crafted with reverence, historical context, and narrative depth. Each chapter weaves together the voices of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John into a single unfolding story of the Messiah’s arrival, ministry, death, and resurrection.
