    <h1>Matthew 24 — The Great Tribulation</h1>
    <blockquote>
      “Verily I say unto you, This generation shall not pass, till all these things be fulfilled.”<br />
      — Matthew 24:34, KJV
    </blockquote>

    <p>Matthew 24 is a scroll of tension—between symbol and siege, heaven and history. The disciples ask about the temple. Jesus answers with earthquakes, famines, betrayals, and cosmic signs. But the center of the scroll is Jerusalem. The collapse is not distant—it is near. The tribulation is not generic—it is covenantal.</p>

    <p>Jesus warns: *“When ye therefore shall see the abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the prophet, stand in the holy place...”* The reference is ancient, but the fulfillment is imminent. The desolation is not metaphor—it is Roman. The holy place will be breached.</p>

    <p>The tribulation is described as unequaled: *“Such as was not since the beginning of the world to this time, no, nor ever shall be.”* The language is cosmic, but the event is local. The siege of Jerusalem is framed as mythic collapse. The covenant reaches its reckoning.</p>

    <p>Jesus speaks of false prophets, fleeing to the mountains, shortened days, and signs in the heavens. But the scroll anchors itself in time: *“This generation shall not pass.”* The Greek word <em>genea (γενεά)</em> means generation, lineage, contemporaries. The prophecy is not deferred—it is fulfilled.</p>

    <p>The Son of Man comes in judgment—not in global arrival, but in covenant reckoning. The language of clouds and angels echoes Daniel 7, but the consequence is AD70. The temple falls. The city burns. The elect are gathered—not from the ends of the earth, but from the ruins of covenant history.</p>

    <p>In Latin, the Vulgate reads: <em>“Amen dico vobis: non praeteribit generatio haec...”</em> This generation will not pass. The scroll closes the loop. The prophets are vindicated. The stones fall. The signs speak. The judgment arrives.</p>

    <p>This scroll belongs in your AD70 shelf as apocalyptic precision. Matthew does not describe distant future—he describes imminent collapse. The tribulation is not abstract—it is historical. The prophecy is not postponed—it is fulfilled. The scroll closes.</p>
