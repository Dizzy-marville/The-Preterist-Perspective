    <h1>Josephus — The Days of Starvation and Fire</h1>
    <blockquote>
      “It was a most miserable case, and a sight that would justly bring tears into our eyes.”<br />
      — Josephus, *Wars of the Jews*, Book V
    </blockquote>

    <p>Josephus does not write prophecy—he writes aftermath. His scroll is not vision—it is witness. The siege of Jerusalem in AD70 is not described in symbols, but in starvation, fire, and betrayal. The temple does not fall in metaphor—it burns in reality.</p>

    <p>He records the famine: mothers devouring their children, bodies piled in silence, the city hollowed by hunger. The Hebrew word <em>ra‘av (רָעָב)</em>—famine—echoes through the scroll, not as metaphor, but as judgment. The covenant has collapsed. The city has become a tomb.</p>

    <p>Josephus describes the fire: the temple engulfed, the gold melting, the sacred space desecrated. Titus did not intend to burn it—but the flame was inevitable. The fire is not just physical—it is covenantal. The house is left desolate.</p>

    <p>The betrayal is internal. Zealots kill priests. Factions war within the walls. The enemy is not just Rome—it is division. Josephus writes: *“It was as though the city had been turned against itself.”* The judgment is not imposed—it is invited.</p>

    <p>Josephus stands between worlds: a Jew writing for Rome, a priest turned historian, a survivor of the collapse. His voice is not neutral—it is haunted. He does not interpret the fall—he catalogs it. But in his catalog, we hear echoes of prophecy fulfilled.</p>

    <p>In Latin, the Vulgate does not preserve Josephus—but the rhythm of his witness aligns with the prophets: *“Wrath is come upon this people to the uttermost.”* The siege is not just political—it is eschatological. The covenant has reached its consequence.</p>

    <p>This scroll belongs in your AD70 shelf not as history—but as fulfillment. Josephus does not speak in symbols—but his witness confirms them. The fire, the famine, the betrayal—they are the body of the prophecy. The temple burns. The city starves. The scroll closes.</p>
