    <h1>Revelation 11 — The Two Witnesses</h1>
    <blockquote>
      “And their dead bodies shall lie in the street of the great city, which spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt, where also our Lord was crucified.”<br />
      — Revelation 11:8, KJV
    </blockquote>

    <p>Revelation 11 is a scroll of measurement and martyrdom. The temple is measured—not to preserve, but to judge. The outer court is cast out. The city is not protected—it is exposed. The measuring rod becomes a ritual threshold.</p>

    <p>The two witnesses appear—not as individuals, but as archetypes. They prophesy in sackcloth. They breathe fire. They shut the heavens. They strike the earth. Their testimony is not gentle—it is apocalyptic. The Greek word for witness, <em>martys (μάρτυς)</em>, means both testimony and death.</p>

    <p>The beast ascends from the abyss. The witnesses are slain. Their bodies lie in the street—unburied, exposed, desecrated. The city is named spiritually: Sodom, Egypt, Jerusalem. The geography is layered. The meaning is mythic. The place of crucifixion becomes the place of collapse.</p>

    <p>The people rejoice. Gifts are exchanged. The death of the witnesses is celebrated. But the celebration is premature. After three and a half days, breath returns. The witnesses rise. Fear falls. The resurrection is not symbolic—it is seismic.</p>

    <p>A great voice calls them up. They ascend. The city quakes. A tenth falls. Seven thousand die. The survivors fear. The judgment is not postponed—it is performed. The scroll becomes liturgy.</p>

    <p>In Latin, the Vulgate reads: <em>“Et corpora eorum in plateis civitatis magnae...”</em> Their bodies in the streets of the great city. The phrase is visual, but the meaning is covenantal. The city is not just guilty—it is judged. The witnesses do not just speak—they embody consequence.</p>

    <p>This scroll belongs in your AD70 shelf as apocalyptic ritual. Revelation 11 does not describe siege—it enacts it. The temple is measured. The witnesses fall. The city trembles. The resurrection speaks. The scroll closes.</p>
