    <h1>Tacitus — Political Turmoil and Religious Collapse</h1>
    <blockquote>
      “The Jews fought with the utmost desperation, and the Romans with all their strength.”<br />
      — Tacitus, *Histories*, Book V
    </blockquote>

    <p>Tacitus does not mourn Jerusalem—he dissects it. His account of AD70 is not prophetic—it is imperial. He writes from Rome, observing Judea as a province in revolt, a religious anomaly, a political inconvenience. Yet his words carry weight: they confirm the collapse from the outside.</p>

    <p>He describes the Jews as fierce, fanatical, and divided. The siege is not just external—it is internal. Tacitus notes that factions within the city destroyed their own grain supplies, ensuring starvation. The judgment is not imposed—it is self-inflicted. The city devours itself before Rome breaches the walls.</p>

    <p>Religion, to Tacitus, is strange. He calls Jewish customs “sinister and abominable,” yet he acknowledges their resilience. The temple, in his view, is not sacred—it is symbolic. Its destruction marks the end of resistance, not the end of covenant. But in your archive, that symbolism is inverted: the fall of the temple is the fulfillment of prophecy, the rupture of the old order.</p>

    <p>Tacitus records the fire, the slaughter, the triumph. He notes that Titus refused to accept the title “conqueror,” claiming he was merely an instrument of fate. That phrase—*instrument of fate*—is mythic. It echoes divine agency, even in Roman detachment. The empire becomes a vessel of judgment.</p>

    <p>In Latin, Tacitus writes: <em>“Iudaei summam desperationem ostendebant...”</em>—the Jews showed utmost desperation. The phrase is clinical, but the reality is covenantal. The desperation is not just military—it is theological. The city has reached its appointed time.</p>

    <p>Tacitus’s scroll belongs in your AD70 shelf as external confirmation. He does not speak in visions—but his record aligns with them. The fire burns. The factions collapse. The temple falls. The empire watches. The scroll closes.</p>
