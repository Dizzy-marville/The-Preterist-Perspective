    <h1>Luke 21 — Wrath Upon This People</h1>
    <blockquote>
      “For these be the days of vengeance, that all things which are written may be fulfilled.”<br />
      — Luke 21:22, KJV
    </blockquote>

    <p>Luke 21 is not a general warning—it is a countdown. Jesus speaks of signs, siege, and scattering. The temple will fall. The city will be surrounded. The people will be led away captive. This is not metaphor—it is covenant consequence.</p>

    <p>The disciples admire the temple’s stones. Jesus replies: *“As for these things which ye behold, the days will come, in the which there shall not be left one stone upon another.”* The collapse is not symbolic—it is structural. The sacred geometry will be dismantled.</p>

    <p>He speaks of wars, earthquakes, famines, and fearful sights. But the center of the scroll is Jerusalem. *“When ye shall see Jerusalem compassed with armies, then know that the desolation thereof is nigh.”* The siege is not distant—it is imminent. The desolation is not abstract—it is geographic.</p>

    <p>Jesus warns: *“Let them which are in Judea flee to the mountains.”* The escape is physical. The judgment is local. The wrath is not cosmic—it is covenantal. *“Wrath upon this people.”* The phrase is surgical. The consequence is precise.</p>

    <p>Luke’s account differs from Matthew and Mark in tone. It is less apocalyptic, more historical. The emphasis is on fulfillment: *“That all things which are written may be fulfilled.”* The scroll closes the loop. The prophets are not vague—they are vindicated.</p>

    <p>In Greek, the word for vengeance is <em>ekdikēsis (ἐκδίκησις)</em>—justice, retribution, covenant reckoning. It is not rage—it is rhythm. The fall of Jerusalem is not random—it is appointed.</p>

    <p>This scroll belongs in your AD70 shelf as prophetic precision. Luke does not describe symbols—he describes siege. The armies surround. The stones fall. The people scatter. The prophecy speaks. The scroll closes.</p>
