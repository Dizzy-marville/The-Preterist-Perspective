    <h1>Mark 13 — Unequaled Distress</h1>
    <blockquote>
      “There shall not be left one stone upon another, that shall not be thrown down.”<br />
      — Mark 13:2, KJV
    </blockquote>

    <p>Mark 13 is a scroll of compression. The prophecy is urgent, the warnings are sharp, and the collapse is near. Jesus speaks not in parables, but in countdowns. The temple will fall. The city will suffer. The elect must endure.</p>

    <p>The disciples marvel at the temple’s stones. Jesus replies with finality: *“Not one stone shall be left upon another.”* The destruction is not symbolic—it is architectural. The sacred geometry will be dismantled. The covenant center will be erased.</p>

    <p>Mark’s account echoes Matthew 24, but with starker brevity. The signs are listed: wars, earthquakes, famines, betrayals. But the emphasis is on vigilance. *“Take heed... Watch... Be not troubled.”* The rhythm is not cosmic—it is personal. The scroll speaks to survivors.</p>

    <p>The abomination of desolation returns, standing where it ought not. The Greek phrase is abrupt: <em>“ὅπου οὐ δεῖ”</em>—where it must not be. The desecration is not metaphor—it is invasion. The holy place will be breached. The desolation is not distant—it is present.</p>

    <p>The tribulation is described as unequaled: *“Such as was not from the beginning of the creation... neither shall be.”* The language is mythic, but the event is historical. The siege of Jerusalem becomes the axis of covenant reversal.</p>

    <p>Jesus warns of false prophets, darkened skies, shaken powers. But the scroll anchors itself in time: *“This generation shall not pass.”* The prophecy is not deferred—it is fulfilled. The stones fall. The signs speak. The judgment arrives.</p>

    <p>In Latin, the Vulgate reads: <em>“Non relinquetur lapis super lapidem...”</em> Not one stone will remain. The phrase is architectural, but the meaning is covenantal. The temple is not just a building—it is a body. Its fall is not just destruction—it is transformation.</p>

    <p>This scroll belongs in your AD70 shelf as sharpened urgency. Mark does not elaborate—he declares. The collapse is not poetic—it is precise. The desolation is not delayed—it is unfolding. The scroll closes.</p>
