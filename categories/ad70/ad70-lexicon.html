    <h1>AD70 Lexicon — Siege, Fire, and Fulfillment</h1>
    <blockquote>
      “For the days shall come upon thee, that thine enemies shall cast a trench about thee, and compass thee round, and keep thee in on every side.”<br />
      — Luke 19:43, KJV

    <p>The AD70 lexicon is not academic—it is eschatological. Each word carries the weight of collapse and the precision of prophecy. The scroll does not just define—it binds. These are not random words—they are covenant vocabulary.</p>

    <p><strong>Thlipsis (θλῖψις)</strong> — Tribulation, affliction, distress. Luke and Matthew use it to describe the siege and suffering of Jerusalem. It is not generic hardship—it is covenant consequence. The city’s walls become a womb of travail.</p>

    <p><strong>Orgē (ὀργή)</strong> — Wrath, anger, righteous fury. Luke speaks of *“wrath upon this people.”* It is not mechanical rage—it is judicial response. The covenant is breached. The temple becomes a target of divine retaliation.</p>

    <p><strong>Erēmōsis (ἐρήμωσις)</strong> — Desolation, forsakenness, ruin. Matthew warns of *“the abomination of desolation.”* The word echoes Daniel. The presence of desecration leads to the absence of God. The holy place becomes a hollow shell.</p>

    <p><strong>Kaumatizō (καυματίζω)</strong> — Burn, scorch, sear. Josephus records the flames consuming the temple. Tacitus writes of the city’s fire. The word is not just physical—it is symbolic. The judgment purifies. The house is left desolate.</p>

    <p><strong>Poliorkos (πολιορκός)</strong> — Besiege, encircle, lay siege to. Luke’s prophecy speaks of trench and compass. The city is not just attacked—it is strangled. The word is a structure. The enemy’s embrace becomes a vice.</p>

    <p><strong>Plērōma (πλήρωμα)</strong> — Fulfillment, completion, fullness. The siege and fall of Jerusalem are described as fulfillment of prophecy. The word is not accidental—it is appointed. The scroll closes the loop. The lexicon reaches its consequence.</p>

    <p>This scroll binds the other six in language. AD70 is not explained in symbols alone—it is defined in words. The siege speaks. The fire consumes. The prophecy fulfills. The lexicon closes.</p>
