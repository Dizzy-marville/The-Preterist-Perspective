    <h1>Revelation 3:10 — Kept from the Hour of Trial</h1>
    <blockquote>
      “Because thou hast kept the word of my patience, I also will keep thee from the hour of temptation, which shall come upon all the world, to try them that dwell upon the earth.”<br />
      — Revelation 3:10, KJV
    </blockquote>

    <p>This verse is part of the message to the church in Philadelphia—a community praised for its endurance and faithfulness. The phrase *“kept the word of my patience”* is key. It suggests not just belief, but long obedience. The Greek word for patience is <em>ὑπομονή (hypomonē)</em>, meaning steadfastness, endurance, staying under pressure. This is not passive waiting—it is active faith.</p>

    <p>The promise follows: *“I also will keep thee from the hour of temptation.”* The Greek word for “keep” is <em>τηρέω (tēreō)</em>, meaning to guard, preserve, or watch over. It’s the same word used in John 17:15: *“I pray not that thou shouldest take them out of the world, but that thou shouldest keep them from the evil.”* This is not escape—it is protection within.</p>

    <p>The “hour of temptation” is rendered from <em>ὥρας πειρασμοῦ (hōras peirasmou)</em>, meaning a time of testing or trial. It is not a literal sixty minutes—it is a season, a moment of global consequence. The phrase *“which shall come upon all the world”* expands the scope. This is not local persecution—it is cosmic testing.</p>

    <p>Preterist interpreters often see this as a reference to the first-century upheavals—Roman persecution, Jewish revolt, and the destruction of Jerusalem. The faithful in Philadelphia are promised preservation—not from discomfort, but from judgment. They are guarded through the storm, not removed from it.</p>

    <p>The phrase *“to try them that dwell upon the earth”* uses <em>δοκιμάσαι (dokimasai)</em>, meaning to test, examine, or prove. The trial is not random—it is diagnostic. It reveals hearts, exposes loyalties, and separates the faithful from the false.</p>

    <p>In Latin, the Vulgate renders this verse as: <em>“Quia servasti verbum patientiae meae, et ego te servabo ab hora tentationis.”</em> The symmetry is clear: because you have kept, I will keep. It is covenant logic—faithfulness begets faithfulness.</p>

    <p>Early Christian writers saw this verse as a comfort in persecution. It was quoted in letters, sermons, and martyr testimonies. The “hour of trial” was not feared—it was endured with the promise of divine keeping.</p>

    <p>Revelation 3:10 is a scroll of refuge. It reminds us that endurance matters, that patience is powerful, and that divine protection is real. It does not promise escape—it promises presence. The faithful are not removed—they are remembered.</p>

    <p>In your archive, this scroll balances the weight of wrath with the grace of preservation. It sits beside the cries of the martyrs and the warnings of tribulation, but it speaks softly: *“Because you have kept, I will keep.”* It is the whisper in the storm, the shelter in the hour, the promise in the pressure.</p>
