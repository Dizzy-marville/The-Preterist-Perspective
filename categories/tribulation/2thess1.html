    <h1>2 Thessalonians 1:6 — Tribulation to Those Who Trouble You</h1>
    <blockquote>
      “Seeing it is a righteous thing with God to recompense tribulation to them that trouble you.”<br />
      — 2 Thessalonians 1:6, KJV
    </blockquote>

    <p>This verse is part of Paul’s opening encouragement to the Thessalonian church—a community enduring persecution and pressure. The phrase *“a righteous thing with God”* frames divine justice not as vengeance, but as moral equilibrium. The Greek word for righteous is <em>δίκαιον (dikaion)</em>, meaning just, fair, fitting. God’s response is not arbitrary—it is aligned with covenant balance.</p>

    <p>The word *recompense* is translated from <em>ἀνταποδοῦναι (antapodounai)</em>, meaning to repay, to return, to give back in kind. It’s a judicial term, often used in legal and covenant contexts. The tribulation endured by the saints is not ignored—it is mirrored back upon the oppressors.</p>

    <p>Paul uses the word <em>θλῖψις (thlipsis)</em> again—tribulation, pressure, crushing. But here, it is turned outward. Those who trouble the faithful will themselves be pressed. The reversal is not vindictive—it is revelatory. It exposes the injustice, restores the balance, and affirms the endurance of the saints.</p>

    <p>In context, Paul is preparing the church for divine intervention. He speaks of Christ returning in flaming fire, taking vengeance on those who do not know God. But this vengeance is framed as justice—not rage. The tribulation is not endless—it is answered.</p>

    <p>In Latin, the Vulgate reads: <em>“si tamen iustum est apud Deum retribuere tribulationem his qui vos tribulant.”</em> The symmetry is clear: tribulation to those who tribulate. It is covenant logic—what is sown is reaped, what is inflicted is returned.</p>

    <p>Early Christian interpreters saw this verse as a comfort in persecution. It was not a call to retaliation—it was a promise of divine reckoning. The faithful were not forgotten, and the oppressors were not unchecked. Justice would come, and it would come rightly.</p>

    <p>2 Thessalonians 1:6 is a scroll of reversal. It reminds us that tribulation is not the final word—that those who trouble the faithful will themselves be troubled. It is not a cry for revenge—it is a declaration of divine order. The pressure will be answered, the balance will be restored, and the faithful will be vindicated.</p>

    <p>In your archive, this scroll adds weight to the tribulation shelf. It sits beside Matthew 10:22 and Revelation 2:10, but it speaks from the other side of the equation. It is the echo of justice, the mirror of affliction, the promise that pressure will not go unanswered.</p>
