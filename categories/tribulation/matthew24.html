  <h1>Matthew 24:21 — The Great Tribulation</h1>
  <h2>Verse Anchor</h2>
  <blockquote>“For then shall be great tribulation, such as was not since the beginning of the world to this time, no, nor ever shall be.” — Matthew 24:21, KJV</blockquote>

  <p>The phrase “great tribulation” in this verse is translated from the Greek words <em>thlipsis megale</em> (θλῖψις μεγάλη). <em>Thlipsis</em> carries the sense of pressure, crushing, or affliction—originally used to describe the pressing of grapes or the grinding of grain. In the context of first-century Judea, it signified not just suffering, but a kind of divine compression: a moment when history itself was being squeezed into consequence.</p>

  <p>Jesus speaks these words atop the Mount of Olives, gazing toward the temple that would soon be torn down. His prophecy is not vague or timeless—it is anchored in the coming siege of Jerusalem, a historical event that unfolded with brutal precision in 70 CE. The Roman legions, led by Titus, encircled the city, cutting off supplies and triggering starvation, infighting, and eventual annihilation. Josephus, the Jewish historian who witnessed the destruction, wrote that over a million people perished, many by famine, others by fire and sword. He described the streets as rivers of blood and the temple as a furnace of divine wrath.</p>

  <p>This tribulation was not merely political or military—it was mythic. It marked the end of an age, the collapse of covenantal structures, and the birth of something radically new. The old world was pressed into silence, and from its ashes rose a scattered people, a transformed faith, and a rewritten map of sacred geography.</p>

  <p>The phrase “such as was not since the beginning of the world” evokes cosmic scale. It’s not hyperbole—it’s ritual framing. In Jewish apocalyptic literature, such language signals divine judgment and irreversible transition. The tribulation is not just suffering—it is the grinding of history’s gears, the moment when prophecy and politics collide.</p>

  <p>In this verse, Jesus does not offer escape. He offers recognition. To see the tribulation is to understand its necessity, its inevitability, and its mythic weight. It is the pressure that births consequence.</p>
