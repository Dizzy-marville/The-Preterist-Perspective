    <h1>Revelation 6:9–11 — The Cry of the Martyrs</h1>
    <blockquote>
      “And when he had opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of them that were slain for the word of God, and for the testimony which they held:  
      And they cried with a loud voice, saying, How long, O Lord, holy and true, dost thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth?  
      And white robes were given unto every one of them; and it was said unto them, that they should rest yet for a little season...”<br />
      — Revelation 6:9–11, KJV
    </blockquote>

    <p>The fifth seal opens not with thunder or fire, but with a vision beneath the altar—a place of sacrifice, memory, and divine presence. The souls of the slain are not forgotten; they are gathered. The Greek word for “souls” is <em>ψυχαὶ (psychai)</em>, meaning breath, life-force, or essence. These are not ghosts—they are witnesses, martyrs whose testimony still burns.</p>

    <p>The altar is symbolic. In the tabernacle and temple, the altar was the place where blood was poured out. To be “under the altar” is to be consecrated, remembered, and positioned within divine justice. These martyrs are not lost—they are held in sacred space.</p>

    <p>Their cry is not passive. *“How long, O Lord?”* is a lament rooted in the Psalms, especially Psalm 13 and Psalm 94. It is the cry of the oppressed, the faithful, the silenced. The Greek phrase <em>ἕως πότε (heōs pote)</em> carries urgency and sorrow. It is not a demand—it is a plea for justice, for recognition, for divine response.</p>

    <p>They call God “holy and true,” affirming His character even as they wait. This is not rebellion—it is covenant fidelity. They do not curse—they cry. Their blood speaks, like Abel’s, from the ground. Their testimony is not erased—it is amplified.</p>

    <p>The request for vengeance is complex. The Greek word <em>ἐκδικέω (ekdikeō)</em> means to vindicate, to carry out justice, to restore balance. It is not personal revenge—it is cosmic reckoning. These martyrs are not asking for violence—they are asking for truth to be revealed, for the scales to be reset.</p>

    <p>Then comes the response: white robes. In Revelation, white robes symbolize purity, victory, and priestly identity. The martyrs are clothed—not just comforted, but honored. The robe is a sign of belonging, of being seen, of being counted among the faithful.</p>

    <p>They are told to rest “for a little season.” The Greek word <em>χρόνος μικρός (chronos mikros)</em> suggests a short time, but also a divinely measured interval. This is not delay—it is preparation. More are yet to be slain, more testimony yet to be sealed. The story is still unfolding.</p>

    <p>Early Christian interpreters saw this passage as a vision of the persecuted church, especially under Roman rule. The martyrs were not forgotten—they were central. Their blood was the seed of the church, their cry the rhythm of history.</p>

    <p>In apocalyptic literature, the cry of the martyrs is not just historical—it is mythic. It represents every silenced voice, every unjust death, every faithful witness. It is the sound beneath the altar, the echo in the silence, the question that shapes the judgment to come.</p>

    <p>Revelation 6:9–11 is not a call to arms—it is a call to memory. It reminds us that justice is not instant, but inevitable. That the slain are not forgotten, but robed. That the cry is heard, even if the answer waits. It is a scroll of sorrow, honor, and holy patience.</p>
