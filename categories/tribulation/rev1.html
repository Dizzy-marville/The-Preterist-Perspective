    <h1>Revelation 1:9 — Companion in Tribulation</h1>
    <blockquote>
      “I John, who also am your brother, and companion in tribulation, and in the kingdom and patience of Jesus Christ, was in the isle that is called Patmos, for the word of God, and for the testimony of Jesus Christ.”<br />
      — Revelation 1:9, KJV
    </blockquote>

    <p>John opens his vision not with authority, but with kinship. *“Your brother and companion in tribulation”* is a phrase of solidarity. The Greek word for companion is <em>συνκοινωνός (synkoinōnos)</em>, meaning co-sharer, fellow participant, one who bears the same burden. John is not above the suffering—he is inside it.</p>

    <p>The word *tribulation* here is again <em>θλῖψις (thlipsis)</em>—pressure, crushing, affliction. John does not speak of it abstractly. He names it, owns it, and shares it. He is on Patmos, exiled for the word and the testimony, but he writes not as a victim, but as a witness.</p>

    <p>He links tribulation with two other realities: *the kingdom and patience of Jesus Christ*. The kingdom is not postponed—it is present. And patience—<em>ὑπομονή (hypomonē)</em>—is the posture of the saints. John is not just enduring exile—he is embodying the rhythm of the kingdom: suffering, waiting, witnessing.</p>

    <p>Patmos itself becomes symbolic. A rocky island in the Aegean, used by Rome as a place of banishment, it becomes the setting for the most cosmic vision in scripture. The place of exile becomes the place of revelation. The silence of isolation becomes the trumpet of prophecy.</p>

    <p>John’s self-description is pastoral. He does not claim superiority—he claims fellowship. He is a brother, a companion, a fellow sufferer. This sets the tone for the entire book of Revelation: it is not written from a throne, but from a cave. It is not shouted from power, but whispered from pressure.</p>

    <p>In Latin, the Vulgate reads: <em>“Ego Ioannes, frater vester et particeps in tribulatione et regno et patientia in Christo Iesu...”</em> The word *particeps* (participant) mirrors *synkoinōnos*—a shared experience, a mutual burden, a collective hope.</p>

    <p>Revelation 1:9 is a scroll of identification. It reminds us that tribulation is not a solo path—it is a shared road. That exile is not abandonment—it is preparation. That the kingdom is not distant—it is present in patience, in pressure, in prophetic witness.</p>

    <p>In your archive, this scroll anchors the tribulation shelf. It is the voice before the seals, the exile before the thunder, the brother before the apocalypse. It reminds us that every scroll is written by someone who endured—and that endurance is the ink of revelation.</p>
