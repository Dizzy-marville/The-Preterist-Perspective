    <h1>Josephus on the Siege — The Days of Starvation and Fire</h1>
    <blockquote>
      “It was now a miserable case, and a sight that would justly bring tears into our eyes, to see the bodies of aged men scattered about the public places, and the young men, already dead, and the children also, gasping for want of food.”<br />
      — *The Wars of the Jews*, Book V
    </blockquote>

    <p>Josephus, a Jewish historian and former general, witnessed the destruction of Jerusalem in 70 AD and recorded it with haunting precision. His account in *The Wars of the Jews* is not merely historical—it is apocalyptic. The siege is described as a slow unraveling of society, where starvation, betrayal, and fire consumed the city from within and without.</p>

    <p>One of the most chilling motifs in Josephus’ account is the famine. He writes of mothers eating their own children, of homes filled with corpses, and of people so desperate they searched sewers and dung heaps for scraps. The city, once sacred, became a tomb. The Hebrew concept of covenant reversal—where blessing turns to curse—is embodied in these scenes. The land groans, the temple burns, and the people perish.</p>

    <p>Josephus describes the fire as both literal and symbolic. The temple, the heart of Jewish worship, was set ablaze by Roman soldiers. He notes that Titus tried to preserve it, but the fury of war overcame restraint. The flames consumed the gold, the cedar, the sacred vessels. It was not just a building—it was the end of an age.</p>

    <p>In one passage, Josephus writes: *“The Romans were enraged at the Jews for the fire, and the Jews were enraged at the Romans for the siege. And so the city burned, not by one hand, but by many.”* This mutual fury reflects the prophetic warnings of Jesus in Luke 21 and Matthew 24: that the city would be surrounded, the people would fall by the edge of the sword, and not one stone would be left upon another.</p>

    <p>Josephus also records the internal collapse. Zealot factions fought each other within the city walls, burning food supplies to force dependence, killing dissenters, and defiling the temple with blood. The siege was not just external—it was civil war, spiritual implosion, covenant fracture.</p>

    <p>His tone is often conflicted. As a Jew writing for Roman patrons, Josephus walks a delicate line. But his sorrow is unmistakable. He calls the destruction “the greatest calamity that ever befell any city.” He sees in it not just military defeat, but divine judgment. The wrath had come—to the uttermost.</p>

    <p>For preterist interpreters, Josephus’ account is a mirror to the New Testament prophecies. The “great tribulation” of Matthew 24, the “wrath upon this people” of Luke 21, and the “cry of the martyrs” in Revelation all find historical resonance in the siege. The prophetic becomes historical. The mythic becomes visible.</p>

    <p>Josephus on the Siege is not just a chronicle—it is a lament. It reminds us that cities can fall, temples can burn, and covenant can be broken. But it also invites reflection: on fidelity, on warning, on the cost of silence. It is a scroll of sorrow, fire, and consequence.</p>
