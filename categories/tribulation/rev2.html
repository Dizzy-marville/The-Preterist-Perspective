    <h1>Revelation 2:10 — Ten Days of Tribulation</h1>
    <blockquote>
      “Fear none of those things which thou shalt suffer: behold, the devil shall cast some of you into prison, that ye may be tried; and ye shall have tribulation ten days: be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee a crown of life.”<br />
      — Revelation 2:10, KJV
    </blockquote>

    <p>This verse is part of the message to the church in Smyrna—one of only two churches in Revelation that receive no rebuke. The tone is sobering but tender. The phrase *“fear none of those things”* is not denial—it’s preparation. The suffering is real, but the fear must be silenced.</p>

    <p>The Greek word for tribulation here is again <em>θλῖψις (thlipsis)</em>, the same crushing pressure found in Matthew 24 and Daniel 12. But here it is measured: *“ten days.”* This number is symbolic—short, finite, but complete. In apocalyptic literature, ten often represents a full cycle of testing. It is not eternal—it is bounded.</p>

    <p>The phrase *“the devil shall cast some of you into prison”* is stark. It frames persecution not just as political or social, but spiritual. The adversary is active, and the saints are the target. Yet even this is permitted for a purpose: *“that ye may be tried.”* The Greek word <em>πειρασθῆτε (peirasthēte)</em> means to be tested, refined, proven. This is not punishment—it is purification.</p>

    <p>Prison in the ancient world was not a place of long-term confinement—it was a holding place before trial or execution. To be cast into prison was to be placed in limbo, awaiting judgment. The church in Smyrna is told to endure this liminal space with faith, not fear.</p>

    <p>Then comes the promise: *“be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee a crown of life.”* The Greek word for crown is <em>στέφανος (stephanos)</em>, a victor’s wreath, not a royal diadem. It is the reward given to those who finish the race, who endure the trial, who remain faithful even when the cost is death.</p>

    <p>This crown is not metaphor—it is covenant. It represents eternal life, divine recognition, and unbreakable belonging. The church in Smyrna may be poor, persecuted, and imprisoned—but they are promised a crown that cannot be taken.</p>

    <p>Early Christian martyrs often quoted this verse before execution. It became a liturgical refrain, a whispered hope in the catacombs and arenas. The “ten days” became a symbol of endurance, and the “crown of life” a symbol of resurrection.</p>

    <p>Revelation 2:10 is not just a warning—it is a liturgy of perseverance. It reminds us that tribulation is real, but it is not endless. That suffering is sharp, but it is not final. That faithfulness, even unto death, is not forgotten—it is crowned.</p>

    <p>In the architecture of your archive, this scroll sits quietly beside the cries of the martyrs, the wrath upon the people, and the siege of Jerusalem. But its tone is different. It is not lament—it is resolve. It is the voice of the faithful, enduring the ten days, awaiting the crown.</p>
