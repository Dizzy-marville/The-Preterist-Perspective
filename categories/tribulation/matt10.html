    <h1>Matthew 10:22 — Enduring to the End</h1>
    <blockquote>
      “And ye shall be hated of all men for my name's sake: but he that endureth to the end shall be saved.”<br />
      — Matthew 10:22, KJV
    </blockquote>

    <p>This verse is spoken as Jesus commissions His disciples, warning them of the cost of bearing His name. The phrase *“hated of all men”* is not hyperbole—it is prophetic realism. The Greek word for “hated” is <em>μισούμενοι (misoumenoi)</em>, a participle that implies ongoing hostility. To follow Christ is to invite rejection, not just from enemies, but from society at large.</p>

    <p>But the verse pivots: *“he that endureth to the end shall be saved.”* The Greek word for endure is <em>ὑπομείνας (hypomeinas)</em>, from <em>ὑπομένω (hypomenō)</em>, meaning to remain under, to persevere, to hold fast beneath pressure. It’s the same root as <em>hypomonē</em> in Revelation 3:10. This is not passive survival—it is active fidelity.</p>

    <p>The phrase *“to the end”* is rendered from <em>εἰς τέλος (eis telos)</em>, meaning unto completion, to the goal, to the finish line. It’s not just about time—it’s about purpose. The endurance is not endless—it is directional. It moves toward salvation, toward covenant fulfillment.</p>

    <p>In context, Jesus is preparing His disciples for rejection, betrayal, and persecution. But He is also anchoring them in promise. The endurance is not futile—it is fruitful. The salvation is not escape—it is vindication.</p>

    <p>Early Christian communities clung to this verse. In martyrdom accounts, it was quoted as a final affirmation. In catechism, it was taught as a rhythm of discipleship. The endurance was not heroic—it was ordinary faithfulness stretched across extraordinary pressure.</p>

    <p>In Latin, the Vulgate reads: <em>“et eritis odio omnibus propter nomen meum: qui autem perseveraverit usque in finem, hic salvus erit.”</em> The word *perseveraverit* (shall have persevered) mirrors the Greek perfectly—faithfulness through fire, not just at the start, but all the way through.</p>

    <p>Matthew 10:22 is a scroll of tension and promise. It reminds us that hatred is not failure, that rejection is not abandonment, and that endurance is not weakness. It is the quiet strength of the faithful, the long obedience in the same direction, the steady pulse beneath the storm.</p>

    <p>In your archive, this scroll belongs beside Revelation 2:10 and 3:10. It completes the triad of endurance: through prison, through trial, through rejection. It is the whisper that says: *“Hold fast. The end is not far.”*</p>
