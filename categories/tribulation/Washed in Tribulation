    <h1>Revelation 7:14 — Washed in Tribulation</h1>

    <h2>Verse Anchor</h2>
    <div class="verse">
      “These are they which came out of great tribulation, and have washed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.” — Revelation 7:14, KJV
    </div>

    <p>This verse reframes tribulation not as destruction, but as purification. The phrase “washed their robes” evokes ritual cleansing, not escape. These are not spared from suffering—they pass through it, and emerge consecrated.</p>

    <p>In the Preterist view, this tribulation aligns with the siege of Jerusalem and the covenantal collapse of the old world. The faithful who endured—whether through martyrdom, exile, or spiritual perseverance—are not forgotten. They are named, robed, and remembered.</p>

    <p>The blood of the Lamb is not literal—it is covenantal. It marks the transition from temple sacrifice to spiritual indwelling. To be washed in blood is to be sealed in fulfillment, to wear the consequence of prophecy as a garment of grace.</p>

    <p>This passage echoes Exodus and Leviticus, where garments are washed before entering sacred space. But here, the cleansing is post-tribulation. The suffering is not a barrier—it is the threshold. The robes are not white because they avoided pain, but because they endured it with faith.</p>

    <p>Revelation 7 is not a pause in judgment—it is a glimpse of aftermath. A vision of those who passed through fire and emerged sanctified. Their robes are testimony. Their whiteness is not purity—it is fulfillment.</p>
