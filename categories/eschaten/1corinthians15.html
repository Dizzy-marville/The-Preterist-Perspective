    <h1>1 Corinthians 15 — The Resurrection of the Dead</h1>
    <blockquote>
      “Behold, I shew you a mystery; We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed.”<br />
      — 1 Corinthians 15:51, KJV
    </blockquote>

    <p>1 Corinthians 15 is not a vision—it is a proclamation. Paul writes with clarity, not metaphor. The resurrection is not vague—it is structured. Christ is the firstfruits. Then those who are His. Then the end. The rhythm is not chaotic—it is covenantal.</p>

    <p>Paul defends the resurrection. If Christ is not raised, faith is vain. The dead are not lost—they are waiting. The resurrection is not optional—it is essential. The Greek word <em>anastasis (ἀνάστασις)</em>—rising up—echoes throughout the scroll. The promise is not symbolic—it is embodied.</p>

    <p>The body is sown in corruption, raised in incorruption. Sown in dishonor, raised in glory. Sown in weakness, raised in power. The transformation is not cosmetic—it is ontological. The mortal puts on immortality. The perishable becomes imperishable.</p>

    <p>Paul speaks of mystery: *“We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed.”* The trumpet sounds. The dead rise. The living are transformed. The moment is not gradual—it is twinkling. The scroll becomes liturgy. The resurrection becomes ritual.</p>

    <p>In Latin, the Vulgate reads: <em>“Omnes quidem resurgemus...”</em>—we shall all rise. The phrase is communal. The resurrection is not private—it is collective. The victory is not partial—it is complete.</p>

    <p>This scroll belongs in your Eschaten shelf as apostolic rhythm. 1 Corinthians 15 does not describe speculation—it declares sequence. The resurrection is not postponed—it is promised. The trumpet sounds. The dead rise. The scroll closes.</p>
