    <h1>Eschaten Lexicon — Resurrection, Judgment, and Renewal</h1>
    <blockquote>
      “He that sat upon the throne said, Behold, I make all things new.”<br />
      — Revelation 21:5, KJV
    </blockquote>

    <p>The Eschaten lexicon is not academic—it is liturgical. Each word carries the weight of transformation and the rhythm of fulfillment. The scroll does not just explain—it enacts. These are not random terms—they are covenant keys.</p>

    <p><strong>Anastasis (ἀνάστασις)</strong> — Resurrection, rising up, restoration. Paul uses it to describe Christ’s victory and the believer’s hope. Daniel speaks of those who sleep in the dust. The word is not symbolic—it is embodied. The grave is not final—it is transitional.</p>

    <p><strong>Krisis (κρίσις)</strong> — Judgment, decision, separation. Revelation opens the books. The throne speaks. The sea gives up its dead. The word is not condemnation—it is consequence. The scroll becomes a court. The covenant is weighed.</p>

    <p><strong>Kainos (καινός)</strong> — New, fresh, unprecedented. Revelation 21 declares a new heaven and earth. The city descends. The temple is replaced. The word is not repetition—it is renewal. The covenant is not repaired—it is reimagined.</p>

    <p><strong>Therapeia (θεραπεία)</strong> — Healing, restoration, service. Revelation 22 speaks of leaves for the healing of nations. The tree bears fruit. The river flows. The word is not medicine—it is Eden. The curse is lifted. The garden returns.</p>

    <p><strong>Telos (τέλος)</strong> — End, goal, fulfillment. Paul writes of the end when Christ delivers the kingdom. The scroll does not describe termination—it describes completion. The word is not finality—it is fullness.</p>

    <p>This scroll binds the other five in language. Eschaten is not just prophecy—it is vocabulary. The resurrection rises. The judgment speaks. The renewal descends. The lexicon closes.</p>
