    <h1>Daniel 12 — Resurrection and the Sealed Book</h1>
    <blockquote>
      “Many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, some to everlasting life, and some to shame and everlasting contempt.”<br />
      — Daniel 12:2, KJV
    </blockquote>

    <p>Daniel 12 is not a vision of conquest—it is a vision of closure. The scroll opens with Michael standing, the time of trouble unfolding, and the people being delivered. The resurrection is not symbolic—it is spoken. The dead rise. The judgment divides. The scroll breathes consequence.</p>

    <p>The prophecy is layered: time, times, and half a time. The abomination is set. The days are numbered. The meaning is veiled. Daniel asks: *“What shall be the end of these things?”* The answer is not explanation—it is sealing. The scroll is not opened—it is preserved.</p>

    <p>The resurrection is dual: some to life, some to contempt. The Greek echoes in the Septuagint: <em>anastēsontai (ἀναστήσονται)</em>—they shall rise. The dust becomes breath. The division is not arbitrary—it is appointed. The judgment is not postponed—it is embedded.</p>

    <p>Daniel is told: *“Seal the book, even to the time of the end.”* The scroll becomes a vessel. The knowledge is not lost—it is delayed. The sealing is not suppression—it is sanctification. The prophecy is not for Daniel—it is for fulfillment.</p>

    <p>In Latin, the Vulgate reads: <em>“Et multi de dormientibus in terrae pulvere...”</em>—many who sleep in the dust of the earth. The phrase is poetic, but the meaning is mythic. The resurrection is not metaphor—it is covenant reversal.</p>

    <p>This scroll belongs in your Eschaten shelf as prophetic sealing. Daniel 12 does not describe the end—it preserves it. The resurrection is spoken. The book is closed. The time is appointed. The scroll closes.</p>
