    <h1>Revelation 21 — The New Heaven and New Earth</h1>
    <blockquote>
      “And I saw a new heaven and a new earth: for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away.”<br />
      — Revelation 21:1, KJV
    </blockquote>

    <p>Revelation 21 is not aftermath—it is arrival. The judgment has passed. The scroll opens with vision: a new heaven, a new earth, a holy city descending. The former things are gone. The rhythm is not destruction—it is renewal.</p>

    <p>The city is not built—it is revealed. The New Jerusalem descends, prepared as a bride. The Greek word <em>kainos (καινός)</em>—new—means fresh, renewed, unprecedented. This is not a rebuilt temple—it is a reimagined cosmos. The covenant is not repaired—it is fulfilled.</p>

    <p>God dwells with humanity. The tabernacle is not distant—it is among them. The tears are wiped. The death is gone. The pain is past. The voice from the throne declares: *“Behold, I make all things new.”* The scroll becomes liturgy. The throne becomes sanctuary.</p>

    <p>The city has no temple. The Lord God and the Lamb are its temple. The geometry shifts. The sacred space is not enclosed—it is embodied. The light is not from sun or moon—it is from glory. The gates are never shut. The nations walk in light. The rhythm is not exclusion—it is invitation.</p>

    <p>In Latin, the Vulgate reads: <em>“Et vidi caelum novum et terram novam...”</em>—I saw a new heaven and a new earth. The phrase is cosmic, but the meaning is covenantal. The scroll does not describe geography—it describes fulfillment.</p>

    <p>This scroll belongs in your Eschaten shelf as Edenic restoration. Revelation 21 does not describe escape—it describes arrival. The city descends. The tears are wiped. The light shines. The scroll closes.</p>
