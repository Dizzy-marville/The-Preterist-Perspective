    <h1>Revelation 22 — The River and the Tree</h1>
    <blockquote>
      “And he shewed me a pure river of water of life, clear as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb.”<br />
      — Revelation 22:1, KJV
    </blockquote>

    <p>Revelation 22 is not a conclusion—it is a return. The scroll opens with water: a river of life, clear as crystal, flowing from the throne. The throne does not sit in judgment—it pours renewal. The geometry is not vertical—it is flowing.</p>

    <p>The tree of life reappears. It bears twelve fruits, one for each month. The leaves are for healing. The Greek word <em>therapeia (θεραπεία)</em>—healing, restoration—echoes Eden. The garden is not lost—it is restored. The curse is not remembered—it is removed.</p>

    <p>The servants see His face. The name is on their foreheads. The night is gone. The lamp is not needed. The Lord gives light. The reign is eternal. The scroll becomes sanctuary. The throne becomes intimacy.</p>

    <p>The angel declares: *“These sayings are faithful and true.”* The prophecy is not cryptic—it is covenantal. The time is near. The invitation is open. *“Let him that is athirst come.”* The scroll does not close with warning—it closes with welcome.</p>

    <p>In Latin, the Vulgate reads: <em>“Et ostendit mihi fluvium aquae vitae...”</em>—He showed me the river of the water of life. The phrase is visual, but the meaning is mythic. The water flows not just through the city—but through the covenant.</p>

    <p>This scroll belongs in your Eschaten shelf as Edenic return. Revelation 22 does not describe escape—it describes restoration. The river flows. The tree bears. The light shines. The invitation stands. The scroll closes.</p>
