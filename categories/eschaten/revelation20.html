    <h1>Revelation 20 — The Thousand Years and the Final Judgment</h1>
    <blockquote>
      “And I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God; and the books were opened.”<br />
      — Revelation 20:12, KJV
    </blockquote>

    <p>Revelation 20 is not a timeline—it is a throne room. The thousand years are not measured in clocks—they are framed in consequence. The scroll opens with binding: Satan is chained, the abyss is sealed. The restraint is symbolic, but the silence is real.</p>

    <p>The martyrs reign. The souls of those beheaded for the witness of Jesus live and rule. This is not metaphor—it is vindication. The Greek word <em>zēsan (ἔζησαν)</em>—they lived—echoes resurrection. The first resurrection is not physical—it is covenantal. The faithful rise in reign.</p>

    <p>After the thousand years, the restraint breaks. Satan is loosed. Nations gather. Gog and Magog rise. The battle is not fought—it is consumed. Fire descends. The judgment is swift. The scroll does not describe war—it describes closure.</p>

    <p>The final judgment arrives. The dead stand. The books open. The sea gives up its dead. Death and Hades surrender. The lake of fire receives. The imagery is layered—book, throne, fire, sea. The rhythm is not chaotic—it is judicial.</p>

    <p>In Latin, the Vulgate reads: <em>“Et libri aperti sunt...”</em>—and the books were opened. The phrase is archival. The judgment is not arbitrary—it is recorded. The scroll becomes a ledger. The throne becomes a court.</p>

    <p>This scroll belongs in your Eschaten shelf as judicial closure. Revelation 20 does not describe delay—it describes decision. The thousand years are not a pause—they are a reign. The judgment is not postponed—it is performed. The scroll closes.</p>
