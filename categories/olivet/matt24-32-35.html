    <h1>Matthew 24:32–35 — The Fig Tree and the Generation</h1>
    <blockquote>
      “Verily I say unto you, This generation shall not pass, till all these things be fulfilled.”<br />
      — Matthew 24:34, KJV
    </blockquote>

    <p>Jesus now turns to timing. The fig tree is not just a botanical metaphor—it’s a covenant clock. “When his branch is yet tender, and putteth forth leaves, ye know that summer is nigh.” The signs are visible. The season is near. The judgment is imminent.</p>

    <p>The fig tree had long been a symbol of Israel. In Matthew 21, Jesus curses a fig tree for bearing no fruit—a prophetic act foreshadowing the temple’s fate. Now, he uses the tree again—not to curse, but to calibrate. The leaves signal the season. The signs signal the end.</p>

    <p>Then comes the anchor: “This generation shall not pass.” The Greek word <em>genea (γενεά)</em> means contemporaries, lineage, covenant heirs. It does not mean race. It does not mean future era. It means the people standing there—the ones who heard the warning, saw the signs, and lived through the siege.</p>

    <p>History confirms the timing. Jesus spoke these words around AD30. The temple fell in AD70. Forty years—the span of a biblical generation. Josephus records the siege, the starvation, the fire. Tacitus confirms the revolt, the Roman response, the devastation. The prophecy was not delayed—it was fulfilled.</p>

    <p>Jesus adds, “Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass away.” This is not cosmic collapse—it’s covenant transition. The old order—temple, sacrifice, priesthood—will pass. But the words of the Son will remain. The kingdom will endure. The rhythm will continue.</p>

    <p>This scroll is not about speculation—it’s about precision. The fig tree bloomed. The signs appeared. The generation saw it. The prophecy was fulfilled. The scroll closes.</p>
