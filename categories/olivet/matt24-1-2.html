    <h1>Matthew 24:1–2 — The Stones Will Fall</h1>
    <blockquote>
      “There shall not be left here one stone upon another, that shall not be thrown down.”<br />
      — Matthew 24:2, KJV
    </blockquote>

    <p>Jesus did not speak in abstraction. He stood on the Mount of Olives, gazing at the temple—its white stones, golden façade, and towering courts. His words were not poetic—they were judicial. The disciples admired the architecture. Jesus pronounced its collapse.</p>

    <p>Matthew 24:1–2 is not a vague warning. It is a direct prophecy of the destruction of the Second Temple in Jerusalem. And history confirms it with brutal clarity.</p>

    <p>According to <strong>Josephus</strong>, the Jewish historian who witnessed the siege firsthand, the temple was razed in AD70 by Roman forces under Titus. In <em>Wars of the Jews</em> (Book 6), he describes the fire, the slaughter, and the leveling of the sanctuary. The stones were torn apart. The gold melted into the cracks. The soldiers pried the blocks apart to retrieve it. The prophecy was fulfilled—literally.</p>

    <p><strong>Tacitus</strong>, the Roman historian, corroborates the chaos. In his <em>Histories</em>, he describes Judea as a land in revolt, the temple as a center of fanaticism, and the Roman response as swift and merciless. The destruction was not symbolic—it was strategic. The temple was not preserved—it was erased.</p>

    <p>Jesus said, “not one stone shall be left upon another.” This was not hyperbole. The temple mount was scraped clean. The sacrificial system ended. The priesthood scattered. The covenant geometry collapsed.</p>

    <p>Modern archaeology confirms the devastation. Excavations around the southern wall of the temple mount reveal massive stones toppled from above—some weighing tons. They lie in silence, exactly as Jesus said they would.</p>

    <p>This scroll is not a lesson—it is a ledger. The prophecy was spoken. The siege came. The stones fell. The Bible was not guessing—it was declaring. Jesus did not mean “someday.” He meant “soon.” And history proves he was right.</p>

    <p>Matthew 24:1–2 is the threshold of the Olivet Discourse. The rest of the scrolls will unfold from this moment—each verse a witness, each warning a fulfilled event. The mountain speaks. The stones fall. The scroll opens.</p>
