    <h1>Olivet Discourse — Prophetic Geometry and Covenant Collapse</h1>
    <blockquote>
      “Verily I say unto you, This generation shall not pass, till all these things be fulfilled.”<br />
      — Matthew 24:34, KJV
    </blockquote>

    <p>The Olivet Discourse is not prediction—it is proclamation. Spoken from the Mount of Olives, facing the temple, it marks the moment when geometry becomes judgment. The stones will fall. The city will burn. The covenant will collapse.</p>

    <p>Jesus speaks of wars, famines, earthquakes—not as signs of the end, but as birth pangs. The rhythm is not global—it is covenantal. The temple is weighed. The disciples ask: *“When shall these things be?”* The answer is not vague—it is near.</p>

    <p>The phrase *“this generation”* anchors the scroll in time. The Greek word <em>genea (γενεά)</em> means lineage, contemporaries, covenant heirs. The judgment is not postponed—it is appointed. The geometry is not symbolic—it is sacred.</p>

    <p>Jesus warns of false messiahs, persecution, betrayal. The abomination stands. The desolation unfolds. The Son of Man comes in judgment—not to end the world, but to end the age. The scroll does not describe escape—it describes reckoning.</p>

    <p>In AD70, the prophecy fulfills. The temple falls. The city starves. The covenant shifts. The Olivet Discourse is not a distant warning—it is a local verdict. The rhythm is not future—it is fulfilled.</p>

    <p>This scroll belongs in your altar as the opening of prophetic consequence. The Olivet Discourse is not just teaching—it is geometry. The mountain speaks. The stones fall. The scroll closes.</p>
