    <h1>Matthew 24:29–31 — The Coming of the Son of Man</h1>
    <blockquote>
      “Then shall appear the sign of the Son of man in heaven... and they shall see the Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory.”<br />
      — Matthew 24:30, KJV
    </blockquote>

    <p>This passage is often misunderstood as a global second coming—but Jesus is speaking in prophetic language, not planetary physics. The imagery is drawn from Isaiah, Ezekiel, and Daniel—where cosmic signs always signal covenant judgment.</p>

    <p>“The sun shall be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light.” This echoes Isaiah 13, where Babylon’s fall is described with celestial collapse. It’s poetic shorthand for regime change, divine judgment, and covenant reversal. The stars falling are not literal—they are symbolic of rulers, priests, and powers being cast down.</p>

    <p>Jesus says, “Then shall appear the sign of the Son of Man in heaven.” The phrase does not mean Jesus appears in the sky—it means his authority is revealed. The Greek word for “heaven” here is <em>ouranos (οὐρανός)</em>, often used to describe the divine realm, not the atmosphere. The sign is not visual—it’s judicial.</p>

    <p>In Daniel 7, the Son of Man comes “with the clouds of heaven” to receive a kingdom. He does not descend to earth—he ascends to the throne. The clouds are not weather—they are glory. Jesus is not returning to earth in this passage—he is being enthroned in judgment over the covenant people.</p>

    <p>Josephus records the aftermath: the temple destroyed, the priesthood scattered, the city burned. The Jewish leadership—those who rejected the Son—were cast down. The judgment was not postponed—it was enthroned.</p>

    <p>Jesus adds, “He shall send his angels with a great sound of a trumpet.” The Greek word <em>angelos (ἄγγελος)</em> means messenger. These are not winged beings—they are apostolic witnesses, gospel heralds, and covenant agents. The trumpet is not a literal blast—it is the announcement of kingdom transfer.</p>

    <p>“They shall gather together his elect from the four winds.” This is not a rapture—it is a regathering. The elect are not removed—they are redefined. The kingdom is no longer centered in Jerusalem—it expands to all nations. The covenant is no longer tribal—it is global.</p>

    <p>This scroll is not about the end of the world—it is about the enthronement of the Son. The clouds speak. The trumpet sounds. The kingdom shifts. The scroll closes.</p>
