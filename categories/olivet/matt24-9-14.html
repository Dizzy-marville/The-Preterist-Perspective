    <h1>Matthew 24:9–14 — Persecution and Gospel Witness</h1>
    <blockquote>
      “And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come.”<br />
      — Matthew 24:14, KJV
    </blockquote>

    <p>Jesus continues the discourse with a sobering forecast: persecution, betrayal, hatred. The disciples will be delivered up. False prophets will rise. Love will grow cold. But in the midst of this, the gospel will be preached to all nations. This is not a contradiction—it’s a covenant rhythm. Suffering and witness walk together.</p>

    <p>History confirms the persecution. The Book of Acts records arrests, beatings, executions. Stephen is stoned. James is killed. Paul is imprisoned. The apostles do not escape tribulation—they embody it. <strong>Josephus</strong> notes the internal strife among Jews, the rise of zealots, and the betrayal of neighbors. The hatred Jesus described was not metaphor—it was manifest.</p>

    <p>Roman records confirm the hostility. <strong>Tacitus</strong> writes of Nero blaming Christians for the fire in Rome, leading to mass executions. The gospel was not welcomed—it was resisted. And yet, it spread.</p>

    <p>By AD70, the gospel had reached the known world. Paul writes to churches in Rome, Corinth, Galatia, Ephesus, Philippi, Colossae, Thessalonica. The message had crossed borders, cultures, languages. The phrase “all the world” uses the Greek <em>oikoumenē (οἰκουμένη)</em>—the inhabited Roman world. It was not hyperbole. It was geography.</p>

    <p>Jesus said the gospel would be preached “for a witness.” The Greek word <em>marturion (μαρτύριον)</em> means testimony, evidence. The preaching was not just evangelism—it was legal declaration. The covenant was being fulfilled. The judgment was being announced.</p>

    <p>Matthew 24:9–14 is not a distant warning—it is a historical ledger. The persecution came. The gospel spread. The end arrived. The prophecy was not postponed—it was performed.</p>
