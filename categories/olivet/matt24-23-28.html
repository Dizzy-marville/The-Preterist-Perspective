    <h1>Matthew 24:23–28 — False Messiahs and the Lightning</h1>
    <blockquote>
      “For there shall arise false Christs, and false prophets... Behold, I have told you before.”<br />
      — Matthew 24:24–25, KJV
    </blockquote>

    <p>Jesus shifts the scroll from escape to exposure. The city is collapsing, and in the chaos, imposters rise. False messiahs. False prophets. Promises of deliverance. Claims of secret appearances. But Jesus warns: “Believe it not.” The deception will be intense—but the signal will be unmistakable.</p>

    <p>History confirms the rise of false messiahs during the Jewish revolt. <strong>Josephus</strong> names several:  
    — Theudas, who promised to part the Jordan  
    — An unnamed Egyptian who led thousands to the Mount of Olives  
    — Simon bar Giora, hailed as a deliverer during the siege  
    — John of Gischala, who seized the temple and claimed divine authority</p>

    <p>These figures did not bring salvation—they brought slaughter. Their movements fractured the city. Their promises led to death. The prophecy was not vague—it was vivid.</p>

    <p>Jesus says, “If they shall say unto you, Behold, he is in the desert; go not forth.” The desert was a known refuge for rebels. “Behold, he is in the secret chambers; believe it not.” The temple itself became a hiding place for zealots and imposters. The warnings were not symbolic—they were strategic.</p>

    <p>Then Jesus gives the true signal: “For as the lightning cometh out of the east, and shineth even unto the west; so shall also the coming of the Son of Man be.” This is not about visibility—it’s about judgment. Lightning is sudden, unmistakable, and destructive. The “coming” is not a gentle arrival—it’s a covenant visitation.</p>

    <p>The Greek word <em>parousia (παρουσία)</em> means presence, arrival, inspection. It was used for royal visits—when a king came to judge his domain. Jesus is not describing a global second coming—he is describing a covenant reckoning. The city will be inspected. The temple will be judged. The lightning will strike.</p>

    <p>Jesus adds a final image: “For wheresoever the carcass is, there will the eagles be gathered together.” The carcass is Jerusalem. The eagles are Rome. The Roman standards bore the image of the eagle. Josephus records that the city was surrounded, the temple defiled, and the bodies piled high. The prophecy was not poetic—it was forensic.</p>

    <p>This scroll exposes the imposters and confirms the signal. The false messiahs rose. The lightning struck. The eagles gathered. The judgment came. The scroll closes.</p>
