    <h1>Matthew 24:36–51 — Watchfulness and Covenant Accountability</h1>
    <blockquote>
      “But of that day and hour knoweth no man... Watch therefore: for ye know not what hour your Lord doth come.”<br />
      — Matthew 24:36, 42 KJV
    </blockquote>

    <p>Jesus now shifts from signs to silence. The exact day and hour are not revealed—not even to the angels. But the judgment is certain. The warning has been given. The covenant is in motion. The call is not to calculate—it is to watch.</p>

    <p>This passage has often been misused to justify endless speculation. But Jesus is not inviting guesswork—he’s demanding readiness. The siege will come. The city will fall. The master will return to inspect his house. The servants must be found faithful.</p>

    <p>Jesus compares the judgment to the days of Noah. People were eating, drinking, marrying—until the flood came. The warning was ignored. The ark was built. The door was closed. The judgment arrived. The parallel is clear: Jerusalem has been warned. The signs have appeared. The escape has been offered. The flood is coming.</p>

    <p>Josephus confirms the complacency. Many in Jerusalem believed the temple would never fall. Some trusted in false prophets. Others mocked the warnings. But the siege came. The city starved. The temple burned. The judgment was not delayed—it was delivered.</p>

    <p>Jesus speaks of two in the field—one taken, one left. This is not a rapture—it is a reckoning. The one “taken” is taken in judgment. The one “left” remains in mercy. The imagery is drawn from covenant separations—like Egypt’s plagues, Babylon’s exile, and Noah’s flood. The faithful are preserved. The unfaithful are swept away.</p>

    <p>Then comes the parable of the good servant and the evil servant. The good servant watches, prepares, and feeds the household. The evil servant delays, abuses, and indulges. When the master returns, the judgment is swift. The servant is cut off. The warning is not abstract—it is personal.</p>

    <p>This scroll is not about guessing—it’s about guarding. The disciples were not told the hour—they were told the signs. They were not given a date—they were given a duty. The covenant was shifting. The kingdom was arriving. The scroll was closing.</p>

    <p>Matthew 24:36–51 is the final call to vigilance. The master is near. The inspection is coming. The servants must be ready. The scroll closes.</p>
