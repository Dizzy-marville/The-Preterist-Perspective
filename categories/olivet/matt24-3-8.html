    <h1>Matthew 24:3–8 — Birth Pangs and Covenant Tremors</h1>
    <blockquote>
      “All these are the beginning of sorrows.”<br />
      — Matthew 24:8, KJV
    </blockquote>

    <p>As Jesus sat on the Mount of Olives, the disciples asked him privately: “Tell us, when shall these things be? and what shall be the sign of thy coming, and of the end of the world?” The question was not about the end of the planet—it was about the end of the age. The Greek word <em>aion (αἰών)</em> means epoch, covenant era, sacred duration.</p>

    <p>Jesus responds with a list: false messiahs, wars, rumors of wars, famines, pestilences, earthquakes. These are not signs of cosmic collapse—they are contractions. The city is in labor. The covenant is groaning. The temple is about to fall.</p>

    <p>History confirms every detail. In the years leading up to AD70, Judea was wracked with unrest. <strong>Josephus</strong> describes multiple false prophets and messianic figures who led rebellions and promised deliverance. The Roman historian <strong>Suetonius</strong> records uprisings and rumors of revolt across the empire.</p>

    <p>Famines struck Jerusalem. Josephus recounts the starvation during the siege—mothers eating their own children, priests dying in the temple courts. Earthquakes shook the region. Tacitus notes seismic events in Asia Minor and Syria. These were not global disasters—they were covenant tremors.</p>

    <p>Jesus calls them “the beginning of sorrows.” The Greek word is <em>odin (ὠδίν)</em>—birth pains. The imagery is not of destruction, but of delivery. Something is ending. Something is being born. The old covenant is collapsing. The kingdom is emerging.</p>

    <p>This scroll is not speculation—it is validation. The signs were given. The contractions began. The disciples were warned. The city was judged. The prophecy was fulfilled.</p>

    <p>Matthew 24:3–8 is not a forecast—it is a contraction chart. The labor has begun. The scroll tightens. The rhythm continues.</p>
