    <h1>The Olivet Discourse — Prophetic Geometry and Covenant Collapse</h1>
    <blockquote>
      “See ye not all these things? verily I say unto you, There shall not be left here one stone upon another...”<br />
      — Matthew 24:2, KJV
    </blockquote>

    <p>The Olivet Discourse is not a forecast of global doom—it is a covenantal reckoning. Spoken from the Mount of Olives, facing the temple, it marks the moment when prophetic geometry becomes historical consequence. The stones will fall. The city will burn. The covenant will collapse.</p>

    <p>This series does not treat the discourse as vague prediction. It treats it as fulfilled prophecy—spoken in rhythm, anchored in covenant, and validated by history. Jesus was not describing the end of the planet. He was describing the end of the Jewish age. The audience was not the world—it was the disciples, heirs of the covenant. The warning was not cosmic—it was local.</p>

    <p>God never judges without warning. If this discourse were about a future global event, the Jews of AD70 would have received no warning—and that is not God’s way. The Olivet Discourse is the final prophetic announcement before the destruction of the temple, the collapse of the sacrificial system, and the reversal of the covenant geometry.</p>

    <p>This series will move verse by verse through Matthew 24, drawing from Mark 13 and Luke 21 as parallel witnesses. Each scroll will blend biblical prophecy with historical fulfillment—Josephus, Tacitus, Roman records, and rabbinic echoes. The goal is not speculation—it is validation. The Bible did not just predict—it described exactly what happened.</p>

    <p>The thesis is simple: the “end times” were the end of the Jewish age. The temple was the center of covenant gravity. When it fell, the age ended. The scrolls to come will show how each verse—each warning, each image, each phrase—was fulfilled in rhythm and consequence.</p>

    <p>This opening scroll is not a conclusion—it is a gateway. The mountain speaks. The stones fall. The covenant shifts. The scroll opens.</p>
