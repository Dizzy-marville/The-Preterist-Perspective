    <h1>Matthew 24:15–22 — The Abomination and the Escape</h1>
    <blockquote>
      “When ye therefore shall see the abomination of desolation... then let them which be in Judaea flee into the mountains.”<br />
      — Matthew 24:15–16, KJV
    </blockquote>

    <p>This passage is not cryptic—it’s urgent. Jesus references Daniel’s prophecy of the “abomination of desolation,” a phrase loaded with covenant consequence. In Daniel, it marked the desecration of the temple. In Jesus’ time, it would mark the final breach before destruction.</p>

    <p>In AD66, Roman forces under Cestius Gallus surrounded Jerusalem. The city was under siege—but then, unexpectedly, the Romans withdrew. This moment became the signal. Early Christians, remembering Jesus’ words, fled to the mountains. <strong>Eusebius</strong, the early church historian, records that believers escaped to Pella, a city in the Decapolis. They did not stay. They did not fight. They fled.</p>

    <p>The “abomination” was not metaphor—it was military. Roman standards, bearing the image of Caesar, were planted in the temple courts. Josephus describes the defilement, the bloodshed, the fire. The holy place was desecrated. The prophecy was fulfilled.</p>

    <p>Jesus warns of urgency: “Let him which is on the housetop not come down.” The escape must be immediate. The siege will be brutal. And it was. Josephus recounts starvation, cannibalism, betrayal. The city became a womb of death. The judgment was not delayed—it descended.</p>

    <p>Jesus adds: “Pray that your flight be not in the winter, neither on the sabbath day.” These are not spiritual metaphors—they are logistical concerns. Winter would hinder travel. Sabbath laws would restrict movement. The warning is practical, precise, and fulfilled.</p>

    <p>He concludes: “For then shall be great tribulation.” This is not a universal apocalypse—it is a localized judgment. The Greek word <em>thlipsis (θλῖψις)</em> means crushing, pressure, affliction. The city was crushed. The covenant was pressed. The scroll was sealed.</p>

    <p>This scroll is not allegory—it is escape protocol. The sign appeared. The believers fled. The city fell. The prophecy was not symbolic—it was surgical. The scroll closes.</p>
