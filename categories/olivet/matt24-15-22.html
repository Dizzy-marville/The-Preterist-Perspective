    <h1>Matthew 24:15–22 — The Abomination and the Escape</h1>
    <blockquote>
      “When ye therefore shall see the abomination of desolation... then let them which be in Judaea flee into the mountains.”<br />
      — Matthew 24:15–16, KJV
    </blockquote>

    <p>This passage is not cryptic—it’s tactical. Jesus references Daniel’s prophecy of the “abomination of desolation,” a phrase loaded with covenant consequence. In Daniel, it marked the desecration of the temple. In Jesus’ time, it would mark the final breach before destruction.</p>

    <p>In AD66, Roman forces under Cestius Gallus surrounded Jerusalem. The city was under siege—but then, inexplicably, the Romans withdrew. Josephus records this moment with astonishment. The siege was tightening, and then it paused. This retreat became a lifeline. Early Christians, remembering Jesus’ warning, fled to the mountains. <strong>Eusebius</strong>, the early church historian, writes that believers escaped to Pella, a city in the Decapolis. They did not stay. They did not fight. They fled.</p>

    <p>The “abomination” was not metaphor—it was military. Roman standards, bearing the image of Caesar, were planted in the temple courts. Josephus describes the defilement, the bloodshed, the fire. The holy place was desecrated. The prophecy was fulfilled.</p>

    <p>Inside the city, chaos reigned. Zealot factions seized control. Civil war erupted within the walls. Josephus recounts priests murdered in the sanctuary, sacrifices halted, and blood spilled on the altar. The temple was no longer holy—it was haunted. The abomination wasn’t just Roman—it was internal. The covenant was defiled from within.</p>

    <p>Jesus warns of urgency: “Let him which is on the housetop not come down.” The escape must be immediate. The siege will be brutal. And it was. Josephus describes starvation so severe that mothers ate their own children. The city became a womb of death. The judgment was not delayed—it descended.</p>

    <p>Jesus adds: “Pray that your flight be not in the winter, neither on the sabbath day.” These are not spiritual metaphors—they are logistical concerns. Winter would hinder travel. Sabbath laws would restrict movement. The warning is practical, precise, and fulfilled.</p>

    <p>He concludes: “For then shall be great tribulation.” This is not a universal apocalypse—it is a localized judgment. The Greek word <em>thlipsis (θλῖψις)</em> means crushing, pressure, affliction. The city was crushed. The covenant was pressed. The scroll was sealed.</p>

    <p>Jesus’ warning wasn’t just judgment—it was mercy. He told them to flee. He told them to pray. He gave them time. The escape to Pella wasn’t luck—it was obedience. The believers who heeded the warning survived. Those who stayed perished.</p>

    <p>This pattern echoes throughout scripture:  
    — Noah warned before the flood  
    — Lot warned before Sodom  
    — Jeremiah warned before Babylon  
    — Jesus warned before AD70</p>

    <p>God never judges without warning. The Olivet Discourse is not a riddle—it’s a rescue.</p>

    <p>The temple was more than a building—it was the center of covenant gravity. Its destruction marked the end of the sacrificial system, the priesthood, and the old age. The abomination wasn’t just military—it was theological. The holy place was desecrated. The covenant was reversed.</p>

    <p>Jesus said, “Except those days should be shortened, there should no flesh be saved.” Josephus confirms that over a million people died. The siege was so brutal that even the Romans were horrified. Titus reportedly tried to negotiate peace—but the zealots refused. The judgment was sealed.</p>

    <p>This scroll is not allegory—it is escape protocol. The sign appeared. The believers fled. The city fell. The prophecy was not symbolic—it was surgical. The scroll closes.</p>
