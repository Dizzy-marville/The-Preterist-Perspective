    <h1>Daniel 7 — The Vision of the Beasts</h1>
    <blockquote>
      “I saw in my vision by night, and, behold, the four winds of the heaven strove upon the great sea. And four great beasts came up from the sea, diverse one from another.”<br />
      — Daniel 7:2–3, KJV
    </blockquote>

    <p>Daniel’s seventh chapter marks a shift—from historical narrative to symbolic vision. The prophet dreams of beasts rising from the sea, each representing empires, each shaped by power and distortion. The sea itself is mythic—chaotic, untamed, the place where monsters dwell. In Hebrew cosmology, the sea is not neutral—it is the abyss.</p>

    <p>The four beasts are described in sequence: a lion with eagle’s wings, a bear raised on one side, a leopard with four heads, and a fourth beast—terrible, strong, and unlike the others. These are not zoological—they are political. They represent Babylon, Medo-Persia, Greece, and Rome, or in some interpretations, successive dominions that culminate in imperial oppression.</p>

    <p>The fourth beast is the climax. It has iron teeth, devours, breaks, and tramples. It sprouts ten horns, and among them, a little horn rises—speaking great things, waging war against the saints. This horn is not just political—it is arrogant, blasphemous, mythic. It is the embodiment of anti-covenant power.</p>

    <p>Then the vision shifts: *“Thrones were cast down, and the Ancient of Days did sit.”* The courtroom opens. The Ancient of Days—God enthroned in fire and judgment—takes His seat. The books are opened. Judgment begins. The beast is slain, its body burned, its dominion revoked. The vision moves from chaos to order, from empire to covenant.</p>

    <p>Daniel sees *“one like the Son of man”* coming with the clouds of heaven. This figure is given dominion, glory, and a kingdom that shall not pass away. The phrase *Son of man* is both human and divine—used by Jesus to describe Himself, and by Daniel to describe the one who inherits eternal rule. It is the hinge of the vision.</p>

    <p>In Latin, the Vulgate renders *Son of man* as *filius hominis*, and *Ancient of Days* as *antiquus dierum*. The contrast is stark: eternal age meets ascending humanity. The beasts fall, the throne stands, the kingdom is transferred.</p>

    <p>Daniel 7 is not just a vision—it is a liturgy of reversal. Empires rise from the sea, but the kingdom comes from the clouds. The beasts devour, but the saints inherit. The horn boasts, but the books speak. It is a scroll of judgment, transition, and mythic justice.</p>

    <p>In your archive, this scroll anchors the Prophecy shelf in apocalyptic rhythm. It sets the tone for symbolic layering, imperial critique, and covenant restoration. The beasts rise, but they do not reign. The throne burns, the books open, and the saints receive the kingdom.</p>
