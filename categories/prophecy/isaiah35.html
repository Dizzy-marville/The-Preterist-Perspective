    <h1>Isaiah 35 — The Blooming Wilderness</h1>
    <blockquote>
      “The wilderness and the solitary place shall be glad for them; and the desert shall rejoice, and blossom as the rose.”<br />
      — Isaiah 35:1, KJV
    </blockquote>

    <p>Isaiah 35 is a scroll of reversal. The wilderness rejoices. The desert blooms. The solitary place sings. This is not metaphor—it is mythic restoration. The Hebrew word for desert, <em>midbar (מִדְבָּר)</em>, evokes barrenness, silence, exile. But here, it becomes a garden.</p>

    <p>The transformation is not gradual—it is eruptive. *“It shall blossom abundantly, and rejoice even with joy and singing.”* The land responds to redemption. The soil remembers covenant. The wilderness becomes a sanctuary.</p>

    <p>Strength returns to the weak. Hands are strengthened. Knees are confirmed. The fearful are told: *“Be strong, fear not.”* Healing is not just physical—it is emotional, communal, covenantal. The blind see. The deaf hear. The lame leap. The mute sing. The body becomes a liturgy of restoration.</p>

    <p>Waters break forth in the desert. Streams flow in the dry place. The parched ground becomes a pool. The thirsty land becomes springs. This is Edenic reversal—where exile becomes home, and scarcity becomes abundance.</p>

    <p>Then comes the highway: *“And a highway shall be there, and a way, and it shall be called The way of holiness.”* The path is not hidden—it is elevated. The unclean do not pass over it. The redeemed walk there. The ransomed return. The journey is not just physical—it is sacred.</p>

    <p>In Latin, the Vulgate reads: <em>“Laetabitur deserta et invia...”</em> The desert rejoices. The path appears. The joy is not abstract—it is embodied. The sorrow flees. The sighing ceases. The vision ends not with fire, but with singing.</p>

    <p>Isaiah 35 is a scroll of healing and return. It reminds us that restoration is not just survival—it is joy. That deserts can bloom. That sorrow can flee. That the wilderness can become a sanctuary.</p>

    <p>In your archive, this scroll completes the Restoration arc. It stands beside Amos’s booth and Micah’s plowshares. It is not about judgment—it is about joy. The blind see, the lame leap, and the desert sings. It is the rhythm of return in the language of healing.</p>
