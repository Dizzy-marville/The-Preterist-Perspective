    <h1>Habakkuk 2 — The Vision Yet for an Appointed Time</h1>
    <blockquote>
      “For the vision is yet for an appointed time, but at the end it shall speak, and not lie: though it tarry, wait for it; because it will surely come, it will not tarry.”<br />
      — Habakkuk 2:3, KJV
    </blockquote>

    <p>Habakkuk stands on his watchtower, waiting for an answer. He has questioned God’s justice, lamented violence, and wrestled with silence. But now he receives a command: *“Write the vision, and make it plain upon tables.”* The vision is not vague—it is inscribed. The Hebrew word for vision, <em>chazon (חָזוֹן)</em>, means revelation, insight, prophetic sight. It is not imagination—it is disclosure.</p>

    <p>The vision is *“for an appointed time.”* The Hebrew word <em>moed (מוֹעֵד)</em> means season, divine appointment, sacred timing. It is not delayed—it is scheduled. The tarrying is not failure—it is rhythm. *“Though it tarry, wait for it.”* The waiting becomes liturgical. The delay becomes sacred.</p>

    <p>Then comes the contrast: *“Behold, his soul which is lifted up is not upright in him: but the just shall live by his faith.”* Pride and faith are placed side by side. The proud trust in self, in speed, in control. The just trust in God, in timing, in covenant. The Hebrew word for faith, <em>emunah (אֱמוּנָה)</em>, means firmness, fidelity, steadiness. It is not belief—it is loyalty.</p>

    <p>Habakkuk’s vision is not just personal—it is political. The proud are described as greedy, restless, violent. They gather nations, heap up peoples, and build cities with blood. But their glory will fade. Their idols will fail. Their silence will be broken.</p>

    <p>The chapter ends with a whisper: *“But the Lord is in his holy temple: let all the earth keep silence before him.”* The silence is not absence—it is awe. The temple is not empty—it is occupied. The vision is not forgotten—it is unfolding.</p>

    <p>In Latin, the Vulgate reads: <em>“Visio enim adhuc pro tempore, et apparebit in fine...”</em> The vision will appear. It will speak. It will not lie. The delay is not denial—it is preparation.</p>

    <p>Habakkuk 2 is a scroll of waiting and warning. It reminds us that vision is not always immediate, that justice is not always loud, and that faith is not passive—it is persistent. The proud fall. The faithful live. The vision speaks.</p>

    <p>In your archive, this scroll stands quietly beside Isaiah’s bloom and Joel’s outpouring. It is not about eruption—it is about endurance. The watchtower holds. The tables are written. The silence deepens. It is the rhythm of waiting in the language of faith.</p>
