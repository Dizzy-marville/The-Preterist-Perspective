    <h1>Malachi 4 — The Sun of Righteousness Shall Rise</h1>
    <blockquote>
      “But unto you that fear my name shall the Sun of righteousness arise with healing in his wings; and ye shall go forth, and grow up as calves of the stall.”<br />
      — Malachi 4:2, KJV
    </blockquote>

    <p>Malachi’s final chapter is brief but blazing. It opens with fire: *“Behold, the day cometh, that shall burn as an oven.”* The proud and the wicked are likened to stubble—dry, rootless, combustible. The day is not vague—it is appointed. The Hebrew word for day, <em>yom (יוֹם)</em>, carries weight: it is not just time—it is consequence.</p>

    <p>But then comes the reversal: *“Unto you that fear my name shall the Sun of righteousness arise.”* The image is cosmic and intimate. The sun rises—not to scorch, but to heal. The Hebrew word for wings, <em>kanaph (כָּנָף)</em>, evokes shelter, movement, and divine embrace. The healing is not abstract—it is embodied.</p>

    <p>The righteous go forth like calves released from the stall—leaping, growing, restored. The metaphor is agricultural, joyful, kinetic. The stall is confinement. The field is freedom. The healing is not passive—it is exuberant.</p>

    <p>Malachi continues: *“Ye shall tread down the wicked.”* The reversal is complete. The oppressed become triumphant. The stubble is underfoot. The day of the Lord is not just judgment—it is vindication.</p>

    <p>Then comes the echo of Moses and Elijah: *“Remember ye the law of Moses... Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet.”* The scroll closes with covenant memory and prophetic anticipation. Moses anchors the past. Elijah signals the future. The law and the prophet bracket the day of the Lord.</p>

    <p>In Latin, the Vulgate reads: <em>“Orietur vobis timentibus nomen meum sol iustitiae...”</em> The *sol iustitiae*—sun of righteousness—is not just light—it is justice, warmth, and restoration. The wings heal. The day burns. The scroll closes.</p>

    <p>Malachi 4 is a scroll of finality and hope. It reminds us that judgment is not random—it is relational. That healing is not generic—it is covenantal. That the sun rises not just to illuminate—but to restore.</p>

    <p>In your archive, this scroll completes the Prophecy shelf with radiant closure. It stands beside Habakkuk’s waiting and Isaiah’s bloom. It is not about delay—it is about dawn. The fire burns, the sun rises, and the healing flows. It is the rhythm of restoration in the language of light.</p>
