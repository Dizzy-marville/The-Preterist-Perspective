    <h1>Ezekiel 37 — The Valley of Dry Bones</h1>
    <blockquote>
      “The hand of the Lord was upon me, and carried me out in the spirit of the Lord, and set me down in the midst of the valley which was full of bones.”<br />
      — Ezekiel 37:1, KJV
    </blockquote>

    <p>Ezekiel’s vision begins in a valley—not a mountaintop. It is a place of death, silence, and scattered memory. The bones are not buried—they are exposed, dry, forgotten. The Hebrew word for “dry” is <em>yabesah (יָבֵשָׁה)</em>, meaning parched, lifeless, brittle. This is not just physical death—it is covenant disintegration.</p>

    <p>God asks the prophet: *“Can these bones live?”* It is a question of possibility, not probability. Ezekiel responds with reverence: *“O Lord God, thou knowest.”* The vision is not about Ezekiel’s power—it is about divine initiative. The restoration begins with prophecy, not effort.</p>

    <p>Ezekiel is commanded to speak to the bones. The word goes forth before the breath. As he prophesies, the bones come together—bone to bone, sinew to sinew, flesh upon flesh. But there is no breath. The Hebrew word for breath, <em>ruach (רוּחַ)</em>, means wind, spirit, life-force. Without it, the bodies are formed but inert.</p>

    <p>Then Ezekiel is told to prophesy to the wind. The breath enters, and the bodies stand—a great army. This is not resurrection for its own sake—it is restoration of identity. The bones represent the whole house of Israel, scattered in exile, dried by despair, forgotten by empires. The vision is national, covenantal, mythic.</p>

    <p>God declares: *“Behold, O my people, I will open your graves, and cause you to come up out of your graves.”* The language shifts from valley to grave, from bones to people. The restoration is not just physical—it is relational. *“Ye shall know that I am the Lord.”* The breath returns, and so does memory.</p>

    <p>In Latin, the Vulgate reads: <em>“Et factum est verbum Domini ad me...”</em> The word comes first. The bones respond not to force, but to speech. This is prophetic rhythm—creation by utterance, restoration by voice.</p>

    <p>Early interpreters saw this vision as a metaphor for spiritual renewal, national rebirth, and eschatological hope. In Christian tradition, it echoes resurrection. In Jewish tradition, it speaks of return from exile. In both, it is a scroll of divine fidelity.</p>

    <p>Ezekiel 37 is not just a vision—it is a liturgy of reassembly. It reminds us that death is not final, that memory can be restored, and that breath can return to what was scattered. It is the mythic reversal of exile, the reconstitution of covenant, the reanimation of hope.</p>

    <p>In your archive, this scroll rises from the valley to stand beside Isaiah’s mountain and Daniel’s beasts. It is the hinge between judgment and restoration. The bones rattle, the breath enters, and the people stand. It is the sound of resurrection in the language of exile.</p>
