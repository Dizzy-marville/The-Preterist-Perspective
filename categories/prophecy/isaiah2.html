    <h1>Isaiah 2 — The Mountain of the Lord</h1>
    <blockquote>
      “And it shall come to pass in the last days, that the mountain of the Lord’s house shall be established in the top of the mountains, and shall be exalted above the hills; and all nations shall flow unto it.”<br />
      — Isaiah 2:2, KJV
    </blockquote>

    <p>Isaiah’s vision opens not with judgment, but with elevation. The mountain of the Lord is not a place of fear—it is a summit of peace. The phrase *“in the last days”* signals prophetic culmination, not chronological end. It is the moment when sacred geography is re-centered, and the nations are drawn upward.</p>

    <p>The mountain is symbolic. In ancient Near Eastern thought, mountains were places of divine encounter—Sinai, Zion, Carmel. But Isaiah’s mountain is not just local—it is cosmic. It is *“exalted above the hills,”* meaning it transcends tribal boundaries and national pride. It becomes the axis of reconciliation.</p>

    <p>The nations *“flow unto it”*—a poetic reversal of conquest. The Hebrew word <em>naharu (נָהֲרוּ)</em> suggests streaming, movement, pilgrimage. This is not forced submission—it is voluntary ascent. The nations are not dragged—they are drawn.</p>

    <p>Isaiah continues: *“Out of Zion shall go forth the law, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem.”* The mountain becomes a source, not just a summit. It is the place where divine instruction radiates outward. The Hebrew word for law, <em>torah</em>, means teaching, guidance, rhythm. This is not legalism—it is covenant wisdom.</p>

    <p>Then comes the famous reversal: *“They shall beat their swords into plowshares.”* Tools of violence become tools of cultivation. The Hebrew word for plowshare, <em>’ēttîm</em>, evokes the image of breaking ground, preparing soil, planting peace. The transformation is not just political—it is agricultural, elemental, Edenic.</p>

    <p>Isaiah’s vision is echoed in Micah 4, but here it carries the weight of temple restoration. The mountain is not just high—it is holy. It is the place where war ends, where teaching begins, where nations gather not to fight, but to learn.</p>

    <p>In Latin, the Vulgate reads: <em>“Et erit in novissimis diebus: praeparatus mons domus Domini in vertice montium...”</em> The phrase *praeparatus* (prepared) suggests intentionality. This mountain is not accidental—it is appointed, shaped, consecrated.</p>

    <p>Isaiah 2 is a scroll of elevation and peace. It reminds us that prophecy is not only about warning—it is about restoration. That the future is not only fire—it is ascent. That the nations will not always rage—they will one day stream upward, seeking wisdom, seeking the Lord.</p>

    <p>In your archive, this scroll begins the Prophecy shelf with clarity and hope. It sets the tone: sacred geography, covenant renewal, and mythic reversal. The mountain rises, the swords fall, and the nations flow. It is the beginning of the prophetic ascent.</p>
