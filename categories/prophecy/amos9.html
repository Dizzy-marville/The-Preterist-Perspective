    <h1>Amos 9 — Restoration of the Fallen Booth</h1>
    <blockquote>
      “In that day will I raise up the tabernacle of David that is fallen, and close up the breaches thereof; and I will raise up his ruins, and I will build it as in the days of old.”<br />
      — Amos 9:11, KJV
    </blockquote>

    <p>Amos, the shepherd-prophet, ends his scroll not with judgment, but with rebuilding. The *tabernacle of David*—a poetic phrase for the covenant house—is fallen, breached, ruined. But God declares: *“I will raise it up.”* The Hebrew word for tabernacle is <em>sukkah (סֻכָּה)</em>, meaning booth, shelter, temporary dwelling. It evokes fragility, pilgrimage, and sacred memory.</p>

    <p>The restoration is active: *raise up*, *close up*, *build*. These are verbs of divine initiative. The breaches are not ignored—they are healed. The ruins are not mourned—they are rebuilt. The phrase *“as in the days of old”* signals covenant continuity. This is not innovation—it is restoration.</p>

    <p>Amos continues: *“That they may possess the remnant of Edom, and of all the heathen, which are called by my name.”* The restoration is not tribal—it is expansive. The remnant includes Gentiles, outsiders, those once excluded. The booth of David becomes a house of inclusion.</p>

    <p>In Acts 15, James quotes this passage to affirm Gentile inclusion in the early church. The fallen booth is not rebuilt with stone—it is rebuilt with people. The prophecy becomes ecclesiology. The ruins become community.</p>

    <p>The agricultural imagery follows: *“The plowman shall overtake the reaper.”* Time collapses. Harvest overtakes sowing. The hills drip with sweet wine. The exile ends, and the land responds. The restoration is not just political—it is ecological, rhythmic, Edenic.</p>

    <p>In Latin, the Vulgate reads: <em>“In die illa suscitabo tabernaculum David quod cecidit...”</em> The word *suscitabo* (I will raise up) carries resurrection weight. The booth is not just repaired—it is reanimated. The covenant is not just remembered—it is reembodied.</p>

    <p>Amos 9 is a scroll of reversal and renewal. It reminds us that judgment is not the final word. That ruins can rise. That exile can end. That the booth of David, fragile and fallen, can become a house of nations.</p>

    <p>In your archive, this scroll begins the Restoration arc. It stands beside Joel’s outpouring and Zechariah’s lampstand. It is not about fire—it is about fruit. The breaches close, the wine flows, and the booth rises. It is the rhythm of return in the language of promise.</p>
