    <h1>Revelation 11 — The Two Witnesses</h1>
    <blockquote>
      “And I will give power unto my two witnesses, and they shall prophesy a thousand two hundred and threescore days, clothed in sackcloth.”<br />
      — Revelation 11:3, KJV
    </blockquote>

    <p>Revelation 11 opens with measurement—a reed given to gauge the temple, altar, and worshippers. But the outer court is left out, given to the nations. The sacred is preserved, but the profane is permitted. This sets the stage for the witnesses: prophetic voices in a world of desecration.</p>

    <p>The two witnesses are clothed in sackcloth—symbols of mourning, repentance, and prophetic burden. They prophesy for 1,260 days, echoing Daniel’s time, times, and half a time. Their ministry is not triumphant—it is contested, vulnerable, mythic.</p>

    <p>They are described as *“the two olive trees and the two candlesticks standing before the God of the earth.”* This links them to Zechariah 4—divine supply, sacred flame, covenant continuity. They are not self-powered—they are Spirit-fed.</p>

    <p>Fire proceeds from their mouths. They shut the heavens, turn water to blood, and smite the earth with plagues. Their power mirrors Moses and Elijah—law and prophecy, judgment and mercy. But their authority is not institutional—it is testimonial.</p>

    <p>Then comes the rupture: *“The beast that ascendeth out of the bottomless pit shall make war against them, and shall overcome them, and kill them.”* Their bodies lie in the street, unburied, exposed. The city is called spiritually Sodom and Egypt—places of rebellion and bondage. The witnesses are silenced, and the world rejoices.</p>

    <p>But after three and a half days, breath enters them. They stand. Fear falls. A voice calls: *“Come up hither.”* They ascend in a cloud, echoing Elijah’s chariot and Christ’s ascension. Their testimony is sealed—not by survival, but by resurrection.</p>

    <p>In Latin, the Vulgate reads: <em>“Et dabo duobus testibus meis...”</em> The word *testibus* (witnesses) carries legal and prophetic weight. They do not argue—they testify. Their power is not persuasion—it is presence.</p>

    <p>Revelation 11 is a scroll of resistance and resurrection. It reminds us that testimony is costly, that prophetic voice invites violence, and that silence is not the end. The witnesses fall, but they rise. Their breath returns, and their ascent is seen.</p>

    <p>In your archive, this scroll burns beside Joel’s outpouring and Zechariah’s lampstand. It is not about peace—it is about fire. Not about survival—it is about witness. The olive trees stand, the candlesticks burn, and the breath returns. It is the rhythm of testimony in the language of apocalypse.</p>
