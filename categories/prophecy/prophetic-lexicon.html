    <h1>Prophetic Lexicon — Dreams, Visions, and Symbols</h1>
    <blockquote>
      “Hear now my words: If there be a prophet among you, I the Lord will make myself known unto him in a vision, and will speak unto him in a dream.”<br />
      — Numbers 12:6, KJV
    </blockquote>

    <p>Prophetic language is not linear—it is layered. Dreams, visions, and symbols form the grammar of divine disclosure. They do not explain—they evoke. They do not instruct—they invite. The lexicon of prophecy is not a dictionary—it is a doorway.</p>

    <p><strong>Dreams</strong> are nocturnal revelations. They bypass logic and speak in image. Joseph dreams of sheaves and stars. Daniel dreams of beasts and thrones. Dreams are not passive—they are participatory. The Hebrew word <em>chalom (חֲלוֹם)</em> means dream, but also whisper, echo, encounter.</p>

    <p><strong>Visions</strong> are waking revelations. Ezekiel sees wheels within wheels. Isaiah sees the Lord high and lifted up. John sees lampstands, seals, and beasts. The Hebrew word <em>chazon (חָזוֹן)</em> means vision, but also insight, unfolding, sight beyond sight.</p>

    <p><strong>Symbols</strong> are the architecture of prophecy. The lampstand is not furniture—it is presence. The olive tree is not botany—it is supply. The beast is not zoology—it is empire. Symbols do not point—they pulse. They carry weight, memory, consequence.</p>

    <p>Numbers carry meaning. Seven is completeness. Twelve is covenant. Forty is testing. One thousand two hundred and sixty is tribulation. Time becomes texture. Duration becomes drama.</p>

    <p>Colors speak. White is purity. Red is war. Black is famine. Pale is death. Gold is glory. Scarlet is corruption. The palette is not aesthetic—it is theological.</p>

    <p>Directions matter. East is origin. West is exile. North is judgment. South is mystery. Movement is not geography—it is narrative.</p>

    <p>In Latin, the Vulgate often translates vision as <em>visio</em>, dream as <em>somnium</em>, and symbol as <em>signum</em>. These are not just words—they are thresholds. The prophet crosses them, and the reader follows.</p>

    <p>The Prophetic Lexicon is not exhaustive—it is evocative. It reminds us that prophecy is not a code to crack—it is a rhythm to enter. That symbols are not puzzles—they are portals. That dreams are not distractions—they are disclosures.</p>

    <p>In your archive, this scroll stands apart—neither narrative nor vision, but a key. It opens the shelf. It binds the symbols. It whispers the grammar of the sacred. It is the rhythm of meaning in the language of mystery.</p>
