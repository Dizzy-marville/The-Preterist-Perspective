    <h1>Revelation’s Urgency — Things Which Must Shortly Come to Pass</h1>
    <blockquote>
      “The Revelation of Jesus Christ... to show unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass.”<br />
      — Revelation 1:1, KJV
    </blockquote>

    <p>John was not writing a distant forecast. He was delivering a sealed indictment. The scroll was opened. The warnings were dispatched. The judgment was near. From the very first verse, Revelation declares its urgency: “things which must shortly come to pass.”</p>

    <p>The Greek word is <em>tachos (τάχος)</em>—meaning speed, swiftness, imminence. It does not mean delay. It does not mean centuries. It means soon. And the phrase is repeated throughout the book:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>“Behold, I come quickly.” — Revelation 3:11</li>
      <li>“The time is at hand.” — Revelation 1:3</li>
      <li>“Seal not the sayings of the prophecy... for the time is at hand.” — Revelation 22:10</li>
      <li>“Surely I come quickly.” — Revelation 22:20</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This is not poetic pacing—it’s covenant urgency. The scroll is not about the end of the planet. It’s about the end of the temple, the priesthood, and the sacrificial system. The old covenant is collapsing. The kingdom is arriving.</p>

    <h2>📜 The Historical Context</h2>

    <p>Revelation was written during a time of persecution and upheaval. The Roman Empire was tightening its grip. Nero had unleashed terror. Christians were accused, arrested, and executed. The temple in Jerusalem still stood—but not for long.</p>

    <p>Josephus records the siege. Tacitus confirms the unrest. The Jewish revolt had begun. The city was burning from within. Revelation’s imagery—beasts, fire, blood, trumpets—is not cosmic fantasy. It’s covenant indictment.</p>

    <p>The seven churches of Asia Minor—Ephesus, Smyrna, Pergamum, Thyatira, Sardis, Philadelphia, Laodicea—were real communities facing real threats. The warnings were not abstract. They were urgent.</p>

    <h2>⏱️ The Scroll Was Already Opening</h2>

    <p>John is told not to seal the book. Daniel was told to seal his prophecy because the time was not yet. But John is told the opposite: “Seal not the sayings... for the time is at hand.” The judgment is not postponed. The scroll is active.</p>

    <p>By AD70, the temple was destroyed. The priesthood was scattered. The sacrificial system was ended. The covenant center was erased. Revelation’s urgency was not mistaken—it was fulfilled.</p>

    <p>This scroll is not about delay—it’s about delivery. The warnings were real. The judgment was near. The scroll closes.</p>
