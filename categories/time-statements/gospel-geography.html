    <h1>Gospel Geography — The World Has Heard</h1>
    <blockquote>
      “This gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come.”<br />
      — Matthew 24:14, KJV
    </blockquote>

    <p>Jesus didn’t just speak of timing—he spoke of territory. The gospel would go out before the judgment came. Not to every jungle and island, but to the known world—the Roman world. And by AD70, it had.</p>

    <p>The Greek word used is <em>oikoumenē (οἰκουμένη)</em>—meaning the inhabited world, the imperial domain. It stretched from Britannia in the northwest to Judea in the east, from Gaul and Hispania in the west to Egypt and Cyrene in the south. This was the world of roads, trade routes, synagogues, and cities. And the apostles covered it.</p>

    <h2>🌍 The Apostolic Map</h2>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Rome</strong> — Paul wrote and visited; Peter likely martyred there</li>
      <li><strong>Greece</strong> — Churches in Corinth, Thessalonica, Athens</li>
      <li><strong>Asia Minor</strong> — Ephesus, Galatia, Colossae, Laodicea, Smyrna</li>
      <li><strong>North Africa</strong> — Alexandria, Cyrene</li>
      <li><strong>Crete & Cyprus</strong> — Titus and Barnabas</li>
      <li><strong>Syria & Judea</strong> — Antioch, Jerusalem, Damascus</li>
      <li><strong>Spain</strong> — Paul intended to go (Romans 15:24)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Over <strong>50,000 miles of Roman roads</strong> connected these cities. The Mediterranean Sea acted as a highway. Greek was spoken across provinces. Roman citizenship enabled travel. Trade routes and synagogues became launchpads. The apostles didn’t wait—they went.</p>

    <h2>📜 Scripture Confirms the Reach</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>“Their sound went into all the earth, and their words unto the ends of the world.” — Romans 10:18</li>
      <li>“The gospel... has been proclaimed to every creature under heaven.” — Colossians 1:23</li>
      <li>“Faith is spoken of throughout the whole world.” — Romans 1:8</li>
    </ul>

    <p>These weren’t exaggerations. They were geographic affirmations. The gospel had reached the oikoumenē. The prophecy was fulfilled. The warning was global. The judgment was local.</p>

    <h2>⏱️ The End Came After the Witness</h2>

    <p>Jesus said the gospel would be preached “for a witness.” The Greek word is <em>marturion (μαρτύριον)</em>—testimony, evidence, legal declaration. The preaching wasn’t just evangelism—it was covenant closure. The apostles declared the kingdom. The cities heard. The temple fell.</p>

    <p>This scroll is not about speculation—it’s about saturation. The gospel went out. The world heard. The judgment came. The scroll closes.</p>
