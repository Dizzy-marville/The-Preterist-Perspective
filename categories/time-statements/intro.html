    <h1>Introduction — The Rhythm of Fulfillment</h1>
    <blockquote>
      “Verily I say unto you, This generation shall not pass, till all these things be fulfilled.”<br />
      — Matthew 24:34, KJV
    </blockquote>

    <p>Jesus didn’t speak in riddles—he spoke in rhythm. His warnings weren’t vague. His timing wasn’t speculative. From the Mount of Olives to the halls of Caiaphas, he declared that judgment was near, not distant. In <strong>Matthew 16:28</strong>, he said:</p>

    <blockquote>
      “There be some standing here, which shall not taste of death, till they see the Son of Man coming in his kingdom.”
    </blockquote>

    <p>And again in <strong>Matthew 26:64</strong>, standing before the high priest:</p>

    <blockquote>
      “Hereafter shall ye see the Son of Man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven.”
    </blockquote>

    <p>These weren’t poetic flourishes. They were covenant indictments—spoken to living men, fulfilled in living history.</p>

    <h2>⏱️ The Four Scroll Zones of Time Statements</h2>

    <p>This series will explore time statements across four prophetic zones:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Matthew’s Signals</strong> — “This generation shall not pass…”</li>
      <li><strong>Revelation’s Urgency</strong> — “Behold, I come quickly…”</li>
      <li><strong>Apostolic Clocks</strong> — “The end of all things is at hand…”</li>
      <li><strong>Gospel Geography</strong> — “The gospel has been preached in all the world…”</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Each scroll will pair scripture with historical validation—showing that the apostles weren’t mistaken, and the Spirit wasn’t vague. The warnings were real. The fulfillment was near.</p>

    <h2>🌍 Gospel Geography — The World Had Heard</h2>

    <p>Jesus said, “This gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world... and then shall the end come.” The Greek word is <em>oikoumenē</em>—the inhabited world, meaning the Roman Empire. By AD70, the gospel had reached:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Rome</strong> — Paul wrote and visited</li>
      <li><strong>Greece</strong> — Churches in Corinth, Thessalonica, Athens</li>
      <li><strong>Asia Minor</strong> — Ephesus, Galatia, Colossae, Laodicea</li>
      <li><strong>North Africa</strong> — Alexandria, Cyrene</li>
      <li><strong>Crete & Cyprus</strong> — Titus and Barnabas</li>
      <li><strong>Syria & Judea</strong> — Antioch, Jerusalem</li>
      <li><strong>Spain</strong> — Paul intended to go (Romans 15:24)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Over <strong>50,000 miles of Roman roads</strong> and the Mediterranean Sea acted as highways for the gospel. Greek was spoken across provinces. Roman citizenship enabled travel. Trade routes and synagogues became launchpads. The apostles didn’t wait—they went.</p>

    <p>By the time the temple fell, the gospel had reached the known world. The prophecy was fulfilled. The warning was global. The judgment was local.</p>

    <h2>📜 This Series Will Prove It</h2>

    <p>Each scroll will examine a time statement—verse by verse, context by context—paired with historical consequence. We’ll show that the urgency was real, the geography was covered, and the judgment arrived exactly as promised.</p>

    <p>This isn’t a defense. It’s a demonstration. The Bible didn’t exaggerate. It executed. The scroll opens.</p>
