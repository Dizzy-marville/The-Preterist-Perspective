    <h1>The Final Hour — Was Jesus Mistaken, or Was He Fulfilled?</h1>
    <blockquote>
      “The time is short.”<br />
      — 1 Corinthians 7:29, KJV
    </blockquote>

    <p>Some have called <strong>Mark 13:30</strong> “the most embarrassing verse in the Bible.” Jesus said, “This generation shall not pass, till all these things be done.” And critics ask: was he wrong?</p>

    <p>If Jesus was mistaken as a man, then we must ask: was he also mistaken in Revelation? Because Revelation begins with this declaration:</p>

    <blockquote>
      “The Revelation of Jesus Christ... to show unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass.” — Revelation 1:1
    </blockquote>

    <p>That’s not one time. That’s twelve. Over and over, Revelation repeats:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>“Behold, I come quickly.” — Revelation 3:11</li>
      <li>“The time is at hand.” — Revelation 1:3</li>
      <li>“Surely I come quickly.” — Revelation 22:20</li>
    </ul>

    <p>If Jesus was wrong on earth, and wrong from heaven, then what part of the Bible can be trusted? But he wasn’t wrong. He was fulfilled.</p>

    <h2>📜 The Apostles Believed Him</h2>

    <p>They didn’t hedge. They didn’t delay. They echoed his urgency:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>“It is the final hour.” — 1 John 2:18</li>
      <li>“The time is short.” — 1 Corinthians 7:29</li>
      <li>“Judgment must begin.” — 1 Peter 4:17</li>
      <li>“The night is nearly over; the day is almost here.” — Romans 13:11–12</li>
    </ul>

    <p>They weren’t confused. They were watching the covenant collapse. The temple was trembling. The priesthood was fading. The kingdom was arriving.</p>

    <h2>🕊️ Jesus Was Man and God</h2>

    <p>He spoke as a man—but he saw as God. He stood in the tradition of the prophets, but he also stood above them. He didn’t guess. He declared. And when he said “soon,” he meant it.</p>

    <p>He warned of false prophets. He predicted falling away. He named the signs. And history confirms every one. The siege came. The stones fell. The scrolls were sealed.</p>

    <h2>⏱️ The Time Statements Were Not Mistakes</h2>

    <p>They were timestamps. They were covenant clocks. They were fulfilled in rhythm, geography, and consequence. To dismiss them is to dismiss the prophetic integrity of scripture itself.</p>

    <p>This scroll is not a defense—it’s a declaration. Jesus was not mistaken. He was enthroned. The apostles were not confused. They were commissioned. The time statements were not embarrassing. They were exact.</p>

    <p>The final hour came. The judgment fell. The scroll closes.</p>
