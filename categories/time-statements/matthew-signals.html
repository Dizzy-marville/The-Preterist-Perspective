    <h1>Matthew’s Signals — This Generation Shall Not Pass</h1>
    <blockquote>
      “Verily I say unto you, This generation shall not pass, till all these things be fulfilled.”<br />
      — Matthew 24:34, KJV
    </blockquote>

    <p>The sun was setting over Jerusalem. The temple glowed in the fading light, its white stones catching the last warmth of day. Jesus stood on the Mount of Olives, facing the sanctuary that had defined a nation. His disciples admired its grandeur. He saw its collapse.</p>

    <p>“This generation shall not pass,” he said. Not in metaphor. Not in mystery. In rhythm. In covenant timing. The warning was not cosmic—it was local. The judgment was not delayed—it was imminent.</p>

    <p>Matthew’s Gospel records multiple time signals—each one a prophetic timestamp. In <strong>Matthew 16:28</strong>, Jesus says:</p>

    <blockquote>
      “There be some standing here, which shall not taste of death, till they see the Son of Man coming in his kingdom.”
    </blockquote>

    <p>He wasn’t speaking to strangers. He was speaking to covenant heirs. The kingdom was not centuries away—it was approaching like a storm cloud over the temple mount.</p>

    <p>Later, in <strong>Matthew 26:64</strong>, standing before Caiaphas, Jesus declares:</p>

    <blockquote>
      “Hereafter shall ye see the Son of Man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven.”
    </blockquote>

    <p>The high priest heard it. The council heard it. And forty years later, their world collapsed. The temple burned. The priesthood scattered. The covenant reversed. The prophecy was fulfilled.</p>

    <h2>📜 The Generation That Saw It All</h2>

    <p>The Greek word for “generation” is <em>genea (γενεά)</em>—meaning contemporaries, lineage, covenant witnesses. It does not mean race. It does not mean future era. It means the people standing there—the ones who saw the signs, heard the warnings, and lived through the siege.</p>

    <p>Jesus didn’t say “some future generation.” He said “this generation.” And history confirms it. He spoke around AD30. The temple fell in AD70. Forty years—the span of a biblical generation. The prophecy was not postponed. It was performed.</p>

    <h2>🕊️ The Siege and the Silence</h2>

    <p>Josephus, the Jewish historian, records the horror. Roman legions surrounded the city. Factions fought within. Starvation gripped the streets. The temple was defiled. The stones were torn apart. Over a million died. The survivors were scattered. The covenant center was erased.</p>

    <p>Jesus had warned them. Not just once. Not just vaguely. Repeatedly. Urgently. Prophetically. And when the judgment came, it came exactly as he said it would.</p>

    <h2>⏱️ The Rhythm Was Real</h2>

    <p>Matthew’s signals are not theological puzzles. They are historical timestamps. The kingdom came. The judgment arrived. The generation saw it. The scroll closes.</p>
