    <h1>Apostolic Clocks — The End Is at Hand</h1>
    <blockquote>
      “The end of all things is at hand: be ye therefore sober, and watch unto prayer.”<br />
      — 1 Peter 4:7, KJV
    </blockquote>

    <p>The apostles didn’t preach delay. They preached imminence. Their letters weren’t filled with cosmic speculation—they were saturated with covenant urgency. The old age was collapsing. The kingdom was arriving. And the clock was ticking.</p>

    <p>Peter writes, “The end of all things is at hand.” Not “someday.” Not “eventually.” At hand. The Greek word is <em>ēngiken (ἤγγικεν)</em>—meaning has drawn near, is approaching, is imminent. He wasn’t speaking in riddles. He was reading the signs.</p>

    <p>James echoes the urgency: “Behold, the Judge standeth before the door.” The imagery is judicial. The covenant inspection is about to begin. The door is not distant—it’s within reach.</p>

    <p>John writes, “It is the last hour.” Not the last millennium. Not the last age. The last hour. The Greek word is <em>eschatē hōra (ἐσχάτη ὥρα)</em>—final moment, closing phase. The apostles weren’t confused. They were watching the temple tremble.</p>

    <h2>📜 The Apostles Wrote in Real Time</h2>

    <p>Paul tells the Corinthians, “The ends of the ages have come upon us.” He tells the Romans, “The night is far spent, the day is at hand.” He tells the Hebrews, “In these last days, God has spoken to us by his Son.”</p>

    <p>These weren’t theological metaphors. They were covenant timestamps. The old system—sacrifices, priesthood, temple—was fading. The new covenant was being established. The apostles were living in the overlap. And they knew it wouldn’t last long.</p>

    <h2>🕊️ History Confirms the Countdown</h2>

    <p>By the time Peter wrote his epistle, Nero had begun his persecution. Christians were being blamed for the fire in Rome. Arrests and executions followed. The Jewish revolt was stirring. The temple was still standing—but not for long.</p>

    <p>Josephus records the siege. Tacitus confirms the unrest. The apostles weren’t writing in comfort—they were writing in crisis. And their warnings matched the moment.</p>

    <p>When the temple fell in AD70, the old age ended. The sacrificial system was erased. The priesthood was scattered. The covenant center was gone. The apostles had warned them. The judgment had arrived.</p>

    <h2>⏱️ The Clock Was Never Wrong</h2>

    <p>This scroll is not about delay—it’s about delivery. The apostles didn’t miscalculate. They measured the moment. They read the signs. They wrote with urgency. And history confirmed their timing.</p>

    <p>The end of all things was at hand. The scroll closes.</p>
