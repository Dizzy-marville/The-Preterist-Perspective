    <h1>Aion — Age, World, Sacred Duration</h1>
    <blockquote>
      “So shall it be at the end of the world: the angels shall come forth, and sever the wicked from among the just.”<br />
      — Matthew 13:49, KJV
    </blockquote>

    <p><strong>Aion (αἰών)</strong> is not just time—it is sacred duration. The word means age, epoch, world-order. It appears in prophetic scrolls to mark transitions, endings, and covenant boundaries. The end of the aion is not the end of time—it is the end of a structure.</p>

    <p>Jesus speaks of the end of the aion when judgment arrives, the harvest is gathered, and the angels divide. Paul speaks of this present aion as fading. The prophets speak of the age to come. The rhythm is not linear—it is layered.</p>

    <p>In AD70, the aion of temple sacrifice ends. The covenant shifts. The geometry changes. The scroll does not describe apocalypse—it describes transition. The age closes. The kingdom expands.</p>

    <p>This scroll belongs in your Greek shelf as a vessel of sacred time. Aion is not just chronology—it is covenant architecture. The world shifts. The age ends. The scroll closes.</p>
