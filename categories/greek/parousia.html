    <h1>Parousia — Presence, Arrival, Royal Visitation</h1>
    <blockquote>
      “For as the lightning cometh out of the east, and shineth even unto the west; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.”<br />
      — Matthew 24:27, KJV
    </blockquote>

    <p><strong>Parousia (παρουσία)</strong> is not just arrival—it is royal presence. The word means coming, appearing, official visitation. In the ancient world, a parousia marked the arrival of a king, a dignitary, a divine figure. The presence was not casual—it was consequential.</p>

    <p>In prophetic scrolls, parousia describes the coming of the Son of Man. The imagery is cosmic—lightning, clouds, angels. But the meaning is covenantal. The judgment arrives. The temple falls. The scroll opens.</p>

    <p>Paul uses parousia to describe Christ’s return, not as a distant event, but as a covenant reckoning. The word is not about distance—it is about authority. The king does not just arrive—he inspects, judges, transforms.</p>

    <p>In AD70, the parousia is not global—it is local. The city is visited. The temple is weighed. The covenant is fulfilled. The presence is not postponed—it is performed.</p>

    <p>This scroll belongs in your Greek shelf as a vessel of divine arrival. Parousia is not just movement—it is manifestation. The king comes. The judgment speaks. The scroll closes.</p>
