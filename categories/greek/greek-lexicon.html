    <h1>Greek Lexicon — Grammar of Fulfillment</h1>
    <blockquote>
      “Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled.”<br />
      — Matthew 5:18, KJV
    </blockquote>

    <p>This lexicon is not academic—it is architectural. Each word is a beam, a stone, a breath in the temple of meaning. The shelf does not just define—it sings. The grammar is not mechanical—it is mythic.</p>

    <p><strong>Thlipsis (θλῖψις)</strong> — Pressure, crushing, affliction. The covenant groans. The city burns. The prophecy tightens.</p>

    <p><strong>Parousia (παρουσία)</strong> — Presence, arrival, royal visitation. The king inspects. The judgment speaks. The scroll opens.</p>

    <p><strong>Aion (αἰών)</strong> — Age, world, sacred duration. The epoch ends. The geometry shifts. The covenant expands.</p>

    <p><strong>Orgē (ὀργή)</strong> — Wrath, ripening, covenant consequence. The patience ends. The verdict arrives. The fire descends.</p>

    <p><strong>Mystērion (μυστήριον)</strong> — Hidden meaning, sacred disclosure. The veil lifts. The silence speaks. The mystery unveils.</p>

    <p>This scroll binds the shelf in grammar. The Greek is not ornamental—it is foundational. The shelf does not just explain—it fulfills. The prophecy breathes. The language sings. The scroll closes.</p>
