    <h1>Mystērion — Hidden Meaning, Sacred Disclosure</h1>
    <blockquote>
      “Having made known unto us the mystery of his will, according to his good pleasure...”<br />
      — Ephesians 1:9, KJV
    </blockquote>

    <p><strong>Mystērion (μυστήριον)</strong> is not a puzzle—it is a sacred veil. The word means mystery, secret, hidden truth. In apostolic scrolls, mystērion marks the boundary between silence and revelation. The meaning is not concealed forever—it is disclosed in rhythm.</p>

    <p>Paul speaks of the mystery revealed in Christ, the mystery of resurrection, the mystery of the Gentiles grafted in. Daniel is told to seal the book. John is told not to seal it. The timing is not arbitrary—it is appointed.</p>

    <p>Mystērion is not confusion—it is consecration. The truth is not withheld—it is prepared. The scroll does not hide—it waits. The unveiling is not chaotic—it is covenantal.</p>

    <p>This scroll belongs in your Greek shelf as a vessel of sacred timing. Mystērion is not just secrecy—it is mythic disclosure. The veil lifts. The meaning speaks. The scroll closes.</p>
