    <h1>Thlipsis — Pressure, Crushing, Affliction</h1>
    <blockquote>
      “For then shall be great tribulation, such as was not since the beginning of the world...”<br />
      — Matthew 24:21, KJV
    </blockquote>

    <p><strong>Thlipsis (θλῖψις)</strong> is not generic suffering—it is covenant pressure. The word means crushing, pressing, affliction. It appears in prophetic scrolls to describe the siege of Jerusalem, the anguish of judgment, and the travail of fulfillment.</p>

    <p>In AD70, thlipsis is not metaphor—it is starvation, fire, betrayal. The city becomes a womb of pain. The covenant groans. The stones fall. The word carries weight.</p>

    <p>Paul uses thlipsis to describe apostolic suffering. Jesus uses it to describe eschatological consequence. The word is not passive—it is active. It presses. It purifies.</p>

    <p>This scroll belongs in your Greek shelf as a vessel of affliction. Thlipsis is not just hardship—it is mythic compression. The prophecy tightens. The scroll closes.</p>
