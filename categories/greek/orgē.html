    <h1>Orgē — Wrath, Ripening, Covenant Consequence</h1>
    <blockquote>
      “Wrath is come upon them to the uttermost.”<br />
      — 1 Thessalonians 2:16, KJV
    </blockquote>

    <p><strong>Orgē (ὀργή)</strong> is not rage—it is ripening. The word means wrath, indignation, divine response. In prophetic scrolls, orgē marks the moment when patience ends and judgment begins. It is not impulsive—it is appointed.</p>

    <p>Jesus speaks of wrath upon this people. Paul writes of wrath stored up. Revelation pours out bowls of wrath. The rhythm is not chaotic—it is judicial. The covenant has been breached. The consequence arrives.</p>

    <p>In AD70, orgē is not symbolic—it is historical. The temple burns. The city starves. The prophecy fulfills. The wrath is not random—it is covenantal. The scroll does not describe emotion—it describes verdict.</p>

    <p>This scroll belongs in your Greek shelf as a vessel of consequence. Orgē is not fury—it is fulfillment. The judgment ripens. The fire descends. The scroll closes.</p>
