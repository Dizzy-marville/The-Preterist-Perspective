# About This Project

_Preterism is not just a lens—it’s a revelation._

I believe Preterism honors the integrity of Christ’s words, the timing of prophecy, and the covenantal shift that reshaped the sacred landscape.

## 1. Christ’s Authority and Timing

Though Jesus walked as a man, He was—and is—the Son of God. I don’t believe He could be mistaken about:

- **The timing** of His coming in glory  
- **The nature** of that coming  
- **The urgency** He gave to the seven churches in Revelation, urging them to persevere to the end

If Revelation was written after His ascension, and He still spoke of imminent fulfillment, then the timing must be sacred—not symbolic, not delayed.

## 2. The Temple and the Covenant Shift

I believe the **Old Covenant was broken** around AD 60–70, culminating in the destruction of the Second Temple. So why would God dwell in a third physical building?

- The **New Covenant** declares that **we are the temple**  
- The Spirit dwells in people—not in stone  
- A rebuilt temple would contradict the fulfilled promise of indwelling presence

This shift from physical to spiritual is not just theological—it’s prophetic closure.

## 3. The Temple John Measured

If Revelation was written in AD 95, what temple did John measure?

- The Second Temple was already destroyed  
- Was it symbolic? Was it memory? Or was Revelation written earlier?

This question matters. If John measured a real temple, then Revelation likely predates AD 70. That timing aligns with Christ’s warnings, the urgency to the churches, and the Preterist view of fulfilled prophecy.
