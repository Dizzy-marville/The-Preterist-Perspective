"In the days of Herod, king of Judea, there was a priest named Zechariah..."
— Luke 1:5

The story begins in a season of silence.
Four hundred years had passed since a prophet’s voice had thundered in Israel. The sacred scrolls remained open, but the heavens were still. Though generations recited the promises, none had seen their dawn. Yet among the hills of Judah, in the routine of temple service and in the quiet ache of a barren home, the divine was stirring again.
Zechariah, an aging priest of the division of Abijah, had long since surrendered the dream of fatherhood. His wife, Elizabeth—descended from the daughters of Aaron—shared his righteousness, and his reproach. Faithful, blameless, childless. In their longing, they mirrored their nation: awaiting a deliverer, groaning under delay.
But on a particular day, drawn by lot according to the priestly custom, Zechariah entered the sanctuary of the Lord to offer incense. Outside, the people prayed. Inside, the veil of silence lifted.
To the right of the altar stood Gabriel—resplendent, radiant, fearful. Heaven’s voice spoke into earth’s waiting:
"Do not be afraid, Zechariah, for your prayer has been heard."
There would be a son.
Not just any child, but one set apart from the womb. A forerunner after the pattern of Elijah, anointed to turn hearts and prepare the people for the Lord. The name was given: John—Yohanan, “Yahweh has been gracious.”
But Zechariah, like Abraham before him, staggered at the thought. How can this be? His was not a question of curiosity, but of doubt—and so the angel answered not with explanation, but with discipline. His voice, once used in disbelief, would now fall silent until the word was fulfilled.
Mute, yet not forgotten, Zechariah emerged from the temple. The people knew he had seen a vision. He could not speak it, but his silence spoke volumes. His term of service completed, he returned home—and in due time, Elizabeth conceived.
Her exclamation echoed the joy of the barren women before her:
"Thus the Lord has done for me… to take away my reproach among people."
Like Sarah, like Hannah, like Rachel, she bore witness to a God who sees.
Thus begins the new covenant dawn—with a righteous couple, an unexpected child, and the return of the prophetic voice. The heavens were no longer closed. The forerunner was coming. The promise was stirring in the womb.
