    <h1>About This Project</h1>
    <p class="subtitle">Preterism is not just a lens—it’s a revelation.</p>

    <p>I believe Preterism honors the integrity of Christ’s words, the timing of prophecy, and the covenantal shift that reshaped the sacred landscape.</p>

    <h2>1. Christ’s Authority and Timing</h2>
    <p>Though Jesus walked as a man, He was—and is—the Son of God. I don’t believe He could be mistaken about:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The timing of His coming in glory</li>
      <li>The nature of that coming</li>
      <li>The urgency He gave to the seven churches in Revelation, urging them to persevere to the end</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If Revelation was written after His ascension, and He still spoke of imminent fulfillment, then the timing must be sacred—not symbolic, not delayed.</p>

    <h2>2. The Temple and the Covenant Shift</h2>
    <p>I believe the Old Covenant was broken around AD 60–70, culminating in the destruction of the Second Temple. So why would God dwell in a third physical building?</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The New Covenant declares that we are the temple</li>
      <li>The Spirit dwells in people—not in stone</li>
      <li>A rebuilt temple would contradict the fulfilled promise of indwelling presence</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This shift from physical to spiritual is not just theological—it’s prophetic closure.</p>

    <h2>3. The Temple John Measured</h2>
    <p>If Revelation was written in AD 95, what temple did John measure?</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The Second Temple was already destroyed</li>
      <li>Was it symbolic? Was it memory? Or was Revelation written earlier?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This question matters. If John measured a real temple, then Revelation likely predates AD 70. That timing aligns with Christ’s warnings, the urgency to the churches, and the Preterist view of fulfilled prophecy.</p>
